Pink Floyd is one of rock's most successful and influential acts, having sold over 200 million albums worldwide and with 74.5 million certified units in the United States, making them one of the best-selling artists of all time. Currently the band consists of David Gilmour (vocals, guitar) and Nick Mason (drums).  The band's classic lineup was Roger Waters (vocals, bass), David Gilmour (vocals, guitar), Rick Wright (organ, keyboards, vocals) and Nick Mason (drums). Gilmour was brought into the band in 1968 to replace the band's founder, singer, guitarist and songwriter Syd Barrett, who had become increasingly erratic and departed from the band a few months after Gilmour's addition. The band became known for their advancements in the genres of psychedelic rock and progressive rock music, philosophical lyrics, avant-garde compositions, sonic experimentation, innovative cover art and elaborate live shows.   Pink Floyd enjoyed modest success in the late-1960s as a psychedelic band led by Syd Barrett. Barrett's increasingly erratic behavior eventually caused his colleagues to replace him after The Piper at the Gates of Dawn with guitarist David Gilmour. The band went on to record several elaborate concept albums; achieving worldwide success with 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon (The second best-selling album of all time), 1975's Wish You Were Here, 1977's Animals, and 1979's The Wall, among the best-selling, most critically acclaimed, and enduringly popular albums in rock music history. In 1985, singer and bassist Roger Waters declared Pink Floyd defunct. However, the remaining members continued recording and touring under the name, eventually reaching a settlement with Waters giving them rights to the name and most of the songs.  Pink Floyd evolved from an earlier band, formed in 1964, which was at various times called Sigma 6, The Meggadeaths, The Screaming Abdabs, and The Abdabs. When this band split up, some members -- guitarists Bob Klose and Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason, and wind instrument player Rick Wright -- formed a new band called Tea Set, and were joined shortly thereafter by guitarist Syd Barrett, who became the band's primary vocalist as well. When Tea Set found themselves on the same bill as another band with the same name, Barrett came up with an alternative name on the spur of the moment, choosing The Pink Floyd Sound (after two blues musicians, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council). For a time after this they oscillated between 'Tea Set' and 'The Pink Floyd Sound', with the latter name eventually winning out. The word Sound was dropped fairly quickly, but the definite article was still used occasionally for several years afterward, up to about the time of the More soundtrack. In the early days, the band covered rhythm and blues staples such as \\\"Louie, Louie\\\", but gained notoriety for psychedelic interpretations, with extended improvised sections and 'spaced out' solos.  The heavily jazz-oriented Klose left the band to become a photographer shortly before Pink Floyd started recording, leaving an otherwise stable lineup with Barrett on lead guitar, Waters on bass guitar, Mason on drums and Wright switching to keyboards. Barrett started writing his own songs, influenced by American and British psychedelic rock with his own brand of whimsical humor. Pink Floyd became a favorite in the underground movement, playing at such prominent venues as the UFO club, the Marquee Club and the Roundhouse. As their popularity increased, the band members formed Blackhill Enterprises in October 1966, a six-way business partnership with their managers, Peter Jenner and Andrew King, issuing the singles \\\"Arnold Layne\\\" in March 1967 and \\\"See Emily Play\\\" in June 1967. \\\"Arnold Layne\\\" reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart, and \\\"See Emily Play\\\" reached number 6, granting the band its first TV appearance on Top of the Pops in July 1967.  Released in August 1967, the band's debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, is today considered to be a prime example of British psychedelic music, and was generally well-received by critics at the time, and it is now viewed as one of the better debut albums by many critics. The album's tracks, predominantly written by Barrett, showcase poetic lyrics and an eclectic mixture of music, from the avant-garde free-form piece \\\"Interstellar Overdrive\\\" to whimsical songs such as \\\"The Scarecrow\\\", inspired by the Fenlands, a rural region north of Cambridge (Barrett, Gilmour and Waters's home town). Lyrics were entirely surreal and often referred to folklore, such as \\\"The Gnome\\\". The music reflected newer technologies in electronics through its prominent use of stereo panning and electric keyboards. The album was a hit in the UK where it peaked at #6, but did not get much attention in North America, reaching #131 in the U.S. During this period, the band toured with The Jimi Hendrix Experience, which helped to increase its popularity.  As the band became more and more popular, the stresses of life on the road and a significant intake of psychedelic drugs took their toll on Barrett, whose mental health had been deteriorating for several months. While Barrett's behavior has often been attributed to his drug use, there are many who think that a pre-existing condition, possibly schizophrenia, was equally to blame. In January 1968, guitarist David Gilmour joined the band to carry out Syd's playing and singing duties. With Barrett's behavior becoming less and less predictable, and his almost constant use of LSD, he became very unstable, often staring into space while the rest of the band performed. During some performances, he would simply strum one chord for the duration of a concert, or simply begin detuning his guitar. The band's live shows became increasingly ramshackle until, eventually, the other band members simply stopped taking him to the concerts. It was originally hoped that Syd would write for the band with Gilmour performing live, similar to how The Beach Boys had done with Brian Wilson. However, due to Barrett's increasingly difficult compositions, such as \\\"Have You got it Yet?\\\", which changed melodies and chord progression with every take, eventually made the rest of the band give up on this arrangement. Once Barrett's departure was formalized in April 1968, producers Jenner and King decided to remain with him, and the six-way Blackhill partnership was dissolved. The band adopted Steve O'Rourke as manager, and he remained with Pink Floyd until his death in 2003.  Musically, this period was one of experimentation for the band. Gilmour, Waters and Wright each contributed material that had its own voice and sound, giving this material less consistency than the Barrett-dominated early years or the more polished, collaborative sound of later years. Waters mostly wrote low-key, jazzy melodies with dominant bass lines and complex, symbolic lyrics, Gilmour focused on guitar-driven blues jams, and Wright preferred melodic psychedelic keyboard-heavy numbers. Unlike Waters, Gilmour and Wright preferred tracks that had simple lyrics or that were purely instrumental. Some of the band's most experimental music is from this period, such as \\\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\\", consisting largely of feedback and atonal screeches and loops, \\\"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict\\\", which is a series of sped-up voice samples resembling rodents chattering that reaches its climax in an incomprehensible Scottish dialect monologue, and \\\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\\\" (performed under different names during this period), a very Waters-driven song with a bass and keyboard-heavy jam culminating in crashing drums and Waters's primal screams.  Whilst Barrett had written the bulk of the first album, only one Barrett composition, the Piper outtake \\\"Jugband Blues\\\", appeared on the second Floyd album. A Saucerful of Secrets was released in June 1968, reaching #9 in the UK and becoming the only Pink Floyd album not to chart in the U.S. Somewhat uneven due to Barrett's departure, the album still contained much of his psychedelic sound combined with the more experimental music that would be fully showcased on Ummagumma. Hints of the epic, lengthy songs to come are in its centerpiece, the 12-minute title track, but the album was poorly received by critics at the time, although critics today tend to be kinder to the album in the context of their body of work. Future Floyd albums would expand upon the idea of long, sprawling compositions, offering more focused songwriting with each subsequent release.  Pink Floyd were then recruited by director Barbet Schroeder to produce a soundtrack for his film, More, which premiered in May 1969. The music was released as a Floyd album in its own right, Music from the Film More, in July 1969; the album achieved another #9 finish in the UK, and peaked at #153 in the U.S. The band would use this and future soundtrack recording sessions to produce work that may not have fit into the idea of what would appear on a proper Pink Floyd LP; many of the tracks on More (as fans usually call it) were acoustic folk songs, although critics tend to find the collection of the film's music patchy and uneven. Two of these songs, \\\"Green Is the Colour\\\" and \\\"Cymbaline\\\", became fixtures in the band's live sets for a time, as can be heard in the many available bootleg recordings from this period. The latter was also the first Pink Floyd song to deal with Roger Waters's cynical attitude toward the music industry explicitly. The rest of the album consisted of incidental music with a few heavier rock songs thrown in, such as \\\"The Nile Song\\\".  The next record, the double album Ummagumma, was a mix of live recordings and unchecked studio experimentation by the band members, with each member recording half a side of a vinyl record as a solo project (Mason's first wife makes an uncredited contribution as a flautist). Though the album was realized as solo outings and a live set, it was originally intended as a purely avant-garde mixture of sounds from \\\"found\\\" instruments. The subsequent difficulties in recording and lack of group organization led to the shelving of the project. The title is slang for sexual procreation, and reflects the attitude of the band at the time, as frustrations in the studio followed them throughout these sessions. Wildly experimental on the studio disc (except for Waters's pure folk \\\"Grantchester Meadows\\\"), with atonal and jarring piano pieces (\\\"Sysyphus\\\"), meandering folk guitar (\\\"The Narrow Way\\\") and large percussion solos, the live disc featured excellent performances of some of their most popular psychedelic-era compositions and caused critics to receive the album more positively than the previous two albums. With fans, the album was Pink Floyd's most popular release yet, hitting UK #5 and making the U.S. charts at #74.  1970's Atom Heart Mother, the band's first recording with an orchestra, was a collaboration with avant-garde composer Ron Geesin. One side of the album consisted of the title piece, a 23-minute long rock-orchestral suite. The second side featured one song from each of the band's then-current vocalists (Roger Waters's folk-rock \\\"If\\\", David Gilmour's bluesy \\\"Fat Old Sun\\\" and Rick Wright's psychedelic \\\"Summer '68\\\"). Another lengthy piece, \\\"Alan's psychedelic breakfast\\\", was a sound collage of a man cooking and eating breakfast and his thoughts on the matter, linked with instrumentals. The use of incidental sound effects and voice samples would thereafter be an important part of the band's sound. While Atom Heart Mother was considered a huge step back for the band at the time and is still considered one of its most inaccessible albums, it had the best chart performance for the band so far, reaching #1 in the UK and #55 in the U.S., although it has since been described by Gilmour as \\\"a load of rubbish\\\" and Waters as suitable for \\\"throwing in the dustbin and never [being] listened to by anyone ever again.\\\" The album was another transitional piece for the group, hinting at future musical territory such as \\\"Echoes\\\" in its ambitious title track. The popularity of the album allowed Pink Floyd to embark on its first full U.S. tour. Before releasing its next original album, the band released a compilation album, Relics, which contained several early singles and B-sides, along with one original song (Waters's jazzy \\\"Biding My Time\\\").  This is the period in which the Floyd shed their association with the \\\"psychedelic\\\" scene (and its association with Barrett) and became a distinctive band that are difficult to classify. The divergent styles of Gilmour, Waters and Wright (Mason's writing contributions to the group were minimal) were merged into a unique sound. This era contains what many consider to be two of the band's masterpiece albums, The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. The sound became polished and collaborative, with the philosophic lyrics and distinctive bass lines of Waters combining with the unique blues guitar style of Gilmour and Wright's light keyboard melodies. Gilmour was the dominant vocalist throughout this period, and female choirs and Dick Parry's saxophone contributions in the studio became a notable part of the band's style. The sometimes atonal and harsh sound exhibited in the band's earlier years gave way to a very smooth, mellow and soothing sound, and the band's epic, lengthy compositions reached their zenith with \\\"Echoes\\\" from Meddle (although \\\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\\" exceeded it in total length, it was split in two pieces as the opening and closing of Wish You Were Here). This period was not only the beginning but the end of the truly collaborative era of the band; after 1975 Waters's influence became more dominant musically as well as lyrically. Wright's last credited composition and last lead vocal on a studio album until 1994's The Division Bell were in this period, and Gilmour's writing credits sharply declined in frequency until Waters left the band in 1985. The last ties with Barrett were severed in musical, as well as literal, fashion with Wish You Were Here, whose epic tracks \\\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts I-V)\\\"\\/\\\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts VI-IX)\\\" were written both as a tribute and elegy to their friend.  The band's sound was considerably more focused on Meddle (1971), with the 23-minute epic \\\"Echoes\\\" taking up the second side of the LP. \\\"Echoes\\\" is a smooth progressive rock song with extended guitar and keyboard solos and a long segue in the middle consisting largely of synthesized whale song produced on guitar, along with samples of seagull cries, described by Waters as a \\\"sonic poem\\\". Meddle was considered by Nick Mason to be \\\"the first real Pink Floyd album. It introduced the idea of a theme that can be returned to.\\\" The album had the sound and style of the succeeding breakthrough-era Pink Floyd albums but stripped away the orchestra that was prominent in Atom Heart Mother. Meddle also included the atmospheric \\\"One of These Days\\\", a concert favorite featuring Nick Mason's menacing one-line vocal (\\\"One of these days, I'm going to cut you into little pieces\\\"), distorted and bluesy slide guitar, and a melody that at one point segues into a throbbing synthetic pulse quoting the theme tune of the cult classic science fiction television show Doctor Who. The mellow feeling of the next three albums is very present on \\\"Fearless\\\", and this track displays a country influence, as does the prominent pedal steel guitar on \\\"A Pillow of Winds\\\". The latter track is one of the Floyd's very few acoustic love songs. Waters's role as lead songwriter began to take form, with his jazzy \\\"San Tropez\\\" brought to the band practically completed. Meddle was greeted both by critics and fans enthusiastically, and Pink Floyd were rewarded with a #3 album chart peak in the UK; it only reached #70 in U.S. charts, partly because Capitol Records had not provided it with enough publicity support. Today, Meddle remains one of their most well-regarded efforts.  Obscured by Clouds was released in 1972 as the soundtrack to the film La Vallee, another art house film by Barbet Schroeder. This was the band's first U.S. Top 50 album (where it hit #46), hitting at #6 in the UK. While Mason described the album years later as \\\"sensational\\\", it is less well-regarded by critics. The lyrics of \\\"Free Four\\\", the first Pink Floyd song to achieve significant airplay in the U.S., introduced Waters's ruminations on his father's death in World War II which would figure in subsequent albums. Two other songs on the album, \\\"Wots...uh, the Deal\\\" and \\\"Childhood's End\\\", also hint at themes used in later albums, the former focusing on loneliness and desperation which would come to full fruit in the Roger Waters-led era, and the latter hinting much at the next album, fixated on life, death and the passage of time. \\\"Childhood's End\\\", inspired by the Arthur C. Clarke book of the same name, was also Gilmour's last lyrical contribution for 15 years. The album was, to an extent, stylistically different from the preceding Meddle, with the songs generally being shorter, often taking a somewhat pastoral approach compared to the atmospheric use of sound effects and keyboard on sections of Meddle, and sometimes even running into folk rock, blues rock and piano-driven soft rock (\\\"Burning Bridges\\\", \\\"The Gold It's in the...\\\" and \\\"Stay\\\" being the best respective examples for each).  The release of Pink Floyd's massively successful 1973 album, The Dark Side of the Moon, was a watershed moment in the band's popularity. Pink Floyd had stopped issuing singles after 1968's \\\"Point Me at the Sky\\\" and was never a hit-single-driven group, but The Dark Side of the Moon featured a U.S. Top 20 single (\\\"Money\\\"). The album became the band's first #1 on U.S. charts, a huge improvement over its previous recordings. The critically-acclaimed album stayed on the Billboard Top 200 for an unprecedented 741 weeks (including 591 consecutive weeks from 1976 to 1988), establishing a world record and making it one of the top-selling albums of all time. It also remained 301 weeks on UK charts, despite never rising higher than #2 there, and is highly praised by critics. Saxophone forms an important part of the album's sound, exposing the band's jazz influences, and female backing vocals play a key role in helping to diversify the album's texture. For example, straight rock songs such as \\\"Money\\\" and \\\"Time\\\" are placed on either side of mellow pedal steel guitar sounds (reminiscent of Meddle) in \\\"Breathe\\\" and female vocal-laden song \\\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\\" (with Clare Torry on lead vocal), while minimalist instrumental \\\"On the Run\\\" is performed almost entirely on a single synthesizer. Incidental sound effects and snippets of interviews feature alongside the music, many of them taped in the studio. The album's lyrics and sound attempt to describe the different pressures that everyday life places upon human beings. This concept (conceived by Waters in a band meeting around Mason's kitchen table) proved a powerful catalyst for the band and together they drew up a list of themes, several of which would be revisited by Waters on later albums, such as \\\"Us and Them\\\"'s musings on violence and the futility of war, and the themes of insanity and neurosis discussed in \\\"Brain Damage\\\". The album's complicated and precise sound engineering by Alan Parsons set new standards for sound fidelity; this trait became a recognizable aspect of the band's sound and played a part in the lasting chart success of the album, as audiophiles constantly replaced their worn-out copies.  Seeking to capitalize on its newfound fame, the band also released a compilation album, A Nice Pair, which was a gatefold repackaging of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and A Saucerful of Secrets. It was also during this period that director Adrian Maben released the first Pink Floyd concert film, Live at Pompeii. The original theatrical cut featured footage of the band performing in 1971 at an amphitheater in Pompeii with no audience present (only the film crew and stage staff). Fortuitously, Maben also happened to capture some interviews and behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band during recording sessions for Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios, some of which were incorporated alongside other new footage between songs in later versions of Live at Pompeii.  Wish You Were Here, released in 1975, carries an abstract theme of absence: absence of any humanity within the music industry and, most poignantly, the absence of Syd Barrett. Well-known for its popular title track, the album includes the largely instrumental, nine-part song suite \\\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\\", a tribute to Barrett in which the lyrics deal explicitly with the aftermath of his breakdown. Many of the musical influences in the band's past were brought together -- atmospheric keyboards, blues guitar pieces, extended saxophone solos (by Dick Parry), jazz fusion workouts and aggressive slide guitar -- in the suite's different linked parts, culminating in a funeral dirge played with synthesized horn. The remaining tracks on the album, \\\"Welcome to the Machine\\\" and \\\"Have a Cigar\\\", harshly criticize the music industry; the latter is sung by British folk singer Roy Harper. It was the first Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and the U.S. charts, and critics praise it just as enthusiastically as Dark Side of the Moon. In a famous anecdote, a heavyset man with a completely shaved head and eyebrows wandered into the studio while the band was recording \\\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\\". The band could not recognize him for some time, when suddenly one of them realized it was Syd Barrett. He was greeted enthusiastically by the band but subsequently slipped away during the impromptu party for David Gilmour's wedding (which was, coincidentally, also on that day). It was the last time any of the other band members saw him. Gilmour recently confirmed this story, although he could not recall which song they were working on when Syd showed up. Barrett's eyebrow-shaving tendencies would later be revisited in the movie Pink Floyd: The Wall.  During this era, Waters asserted more and more control over Pink Floyd's output. Wright's influence became largely inconsequential, and he was fired from the band during the recording of The Wall. Much of the music from this period is considered secondary to the lyrics, which explore Waters's feelings about his father's death in World War II and his increasingly cynical attitude towards political figures such as Margaret Thatcher and Mary Whitehouse. Although still finely nuanced, the music grew more guitar-based at the expense of keyboards and saxophone, both of which became (at best) part of the music's background texture along with the obligatory sound effects. A full orchestra (even larger than the brass ensemble from Atom Heart Mother) plays a significant role on The Wall and especially The Final Cut.  By January 1977, and the release of Animals (UK #2, U.S. #3), the band's music came under increasing criticism from some quarters in the new punk rock sphere as being too flabby and pretentious, having lost its way from the simplicity of early rock and roll. Animals was, however, considerably more basic-sounding than the previous albums, due to either the influence of the burgeoning punk-rock movement or the fact that the album was recorded at Pink Floyd's new (and somewhat incomplete) Britannia Row Studios. The album was also the first to not have a single songwriting credit for Rick Wright. Animals again contained lengthy songs tied to a theme, this time taken in part from George Orwell's Animal Farm, which used \\\"Pigs\\\", \\\"Dogs\\\" and \\\"Sheep\\\" as metaphors for members of contemporary society. Despite the prominence of guitar, keyboards and synthesizers still play an important role on Animals, but the saxophone and female vocal work that defined much of the previous two albums' sound is absent. The result is a more hard-rock effort overall, bookended by two parts of a quiet acoustic piece. Many critics did not respond well to the album, finding it \\\"tedious\\\" and \\\"bleak\\\", although some celebrated it for almost those very reasons. For the cover artwork, a giant inflatable pig was commissioned to float between the chimney towers of London's Battersea Power Station. However, the wind made the pig balloon difficult to control, and in the end it was necessary to matte a photo of the pig balloon onto the album cover. The pig nevertheless became one of the enduring symbols of Pink Floyd, and inflatable pigs were a staple of the band's live shows from then on.  1979's epic rock opera The Wall, conceived by Waters, dealt with the themes of loneliness and failed communication, which were expressed by the metaphor of a wall built between a rock artist and his audience. This album gave Pink Floyd renewed acclaim and another chart-topping single with \\\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\\\". The Wall also included the future concert staples \\\"Comfortably Numb\\\" and \\\"Run Like Hell\\\", with the former in particular becoming a cornerstone of album-oriented rock and classic-rock radio playlists as well as one of the group's best-known songs. The album was co-produced by Bob Ezrin, a friend of Waters who shared songwriting credits on \\\"The Trial\\\" and from whom the band later temporarily distanced themselves after quarreling with him over several contentious issues. Even more than during the Animals sessions, Waters was asserting his artistic influence and leadership over the band, which prompted increased conflicts with the other members. The music had become distinctly more hard-rock, although the large orchestrations on some tracks recalled an earlier period, and there are a few quieter songs interspersed throughout (such as \\\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\\" and \\\"Nobody Home\\\"). Wright's influence was completely minimized, and he was fired from the band during recording, only returning on a fixed wage for the live shows in support of the album. Ironically, Wright was the only member of Pink Floyd to make any money from The Wall concerts, the rest covering the extensive cost overruns of their most spectacular concerts yet.  Despite never hitting #1 in the UK (it reached #3), The Wall spent 15 weeks atop the U.S. charts during 1980. Critics praised it, and it has sold over 30 million copies worldwide. It is the third-best selling album of all time in the U.S and the best selling album by a single artist to be released during the 1970s. It has been certified 23x platinum by the RIAA, for sales of 11.5 million copies in U.S. alone. The huge commercial success of The Wall made Pink Floyd the only artists since the The Beatles to have the best selling albums of two years (1973 and 1980) in less than a decade.  A film entitled Pink Floyd: The Wall was released in 1982, incorporating essentially all of the music from the album. The film, written by Waters and directed by Alan Parker, starred The Boomtown Rats founder Bob Geldof and featured striking animation by noted British artist and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe. It grossed over $14 million at the North American box office. A song which first appeared in the movie, \\\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\\", was released as a single on a limited basis. This song was finally made widely available on the compilation album Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd and the re-release of The Final Cut. Also in the film is the song \\\"What Shall We Do Now?\\\", which was cut out of the original album due to the time constraints of vinyl records. The only song from the album not used was \\\"Hey You\\\", but a sequence was filmed using the song and it only exists as raw footage with poor visual quality but very good audio quality. It was released for the first time as a bonus with the extras section of the 1999 DVD release as a deleted scene.  1983 saw the release of The Final Cut, dedicated to Roger Waters's father, Eric Fletcher Waters. Even darker in tone than The Wall, this album re-examined many previous themes, while also addressing then-current events, including Waters's anger at Britain's participation in the Falklands War, the blame for which he laid squarely at the feet of political leaders (\\\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\\"). It concludes with a cynical and frightening glimpse at the possibility of nuclear war (\\\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\\"). Michael Kamen and Andy Bown contributed keyboard work in lieu of Richard Wright's departure, which had not been formally announced before the album's release. Though technically a Pink Floyd album, the LP's front cover displayed no words, only the back cover reading: \\\"The Final Cut - A requiem for the post war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd: Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason\\\". Roger Waters received the sole songwriting credit for the entire record, which became a prototype in sound and form for later Waters solo projects. Waters has since said that he offered to release the record as a solo album, but the rest of the band rejected this idea. However, in his book Inside Out, drummer Nick Mason says that no such discussions ever took place. Gilmour reportedly asked Waters to hold back the release of the album so that he could write enough material to contribute, but this request was refused. The music's tone is largely similar to The Wall's but somewhat quieter and softer, resembling songs like \\\"Nobody Home\\\" more than \\\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\\\". It is also more repetitive, with certain leitmotifs cropping up continually. Only moderately successful with fans by Floyd's standards (UK #1, U.S. #6), but reasonably well-received by critics, the album yielded one minor radio hit, \\\"Not Now John\\\", the only hard rock song on the album (and the only one partially sung by Gilmour). The arguments between Waters and Gilmour at this stage are rumored to be so bad that they were supposedly never seen in the recording studio simultaneously, and Gilmour's co-producer credit was dropped from the album sleeve (though he received attendant royalties). There was no tour for the album, although parts of it were performed live by Waters on his subsequent solo jaunts.  After The Final Cut was released, the band members went their separate ways and spent time working on individual projects. Gilmour was the first to complete his solo album, releasing About Face in March 1984. Wright joined forces with Dave Harris of Fashion to form Zee, which released the experimental album Identity a month after Gilmour's project. In May 1984, Waters released The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, a concept album once proposed as a Pink Floyd project. A year after his band mates' projects, Mason released the album Profiles, a collaboration with Rick Fenn of 10cc which featured guest appearances by Gilmour and UFO keyboardist Danny Peyronel.  Waters announced in December of 1985 that he was departing Pink Floyd, describing the band as \\\"a spent force creatively\\\", but in 1986 Gilmour and Mason began recording a new Pink Floyd album. At the same time, Roger Waters was working on his second solo album, entitled Radio K.A.O.S.. A bitter legal dispute ensued with Waters claiming that the name \\\"Pink Floyd\\\" should have been put to rest, but Gilmour and Mason upheld their conviction that they had the legal right to continue as \\\"Pink Floyd.\\\" The suit was eventually settled out of court.  After considering and rejecting many other titles, the new album was released as A Momentary Lapse of Reason (UK #3, U.S. #3). Without Waters, who had been the band's dominant songwriter for over a decade and a half, the band sought the help of outside writers. As Pink Floyd had never done this before (except for the orchestral contributions of Geesin and Ezrin), this move received much criticism. Ezrin, who had by now renewed his friendship with Gilmour, served as co-producer as well as being one of these writers. Rick Wright also returned, at first as a salaried employee during the final recording sessions, and then officially rejoining the band after the subsequent tour.  Gilmour later admitted that Mason had hardly played on the album. Because of Mason and Wright's limited contributions, some critics say that A Momentary Lapse of Reason should really be regarded as a Gilmour solo effort, in much the same way that The Final Cut might be regarded as a Waters album.  A year later, the band released a double live album and a concert video taken from its 1988 Long Island shows, entitled Delicate Sound of Thunder, and later recorded some instrumentals for a classic-car racing film La Carrera Panamericana, set in Mexico and featuring Gilmour and Mason as participating drivers. During the race Gilmour and manager Steve O'Rourke (acting as his map-reader) crashed. O'Rourke suffered a broken leg, but Gilmour walked away with just some bruises. The instrumentals are notable for including the first Floyd material co-written by Wright since 1975, as well as the only Floyd material co-written by Mason since Dark Side of the Moon.  1992 saw the box set release of Shine On. The 9 disc set included re-releases of the studio albums A Saucerful of Secrets, Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall, and A Momentary Lapse of Reason. A bonus disc entitled The Pink Floyd Early Singles was also included. The set's packaging featured a case allowing the albums to stand vertically together, with the side-by-side spines displaying an image of the Dark Side of the Moon cover. The circular text of each CD includes the almost illegible words \\\"The Big Bong Theory\\\".  The band's next recording was the 1994 release The Division Bell, which was much more of a group effort than Momentary Lapse had been, with Wright now reinstated as a full and contributing band member and figuring prominently in the writing credits. The album was received more favorably by critics and fans alike than Lapse had been, but was still heavily criticized as tired and formulaic. It was the second Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and U.S. charts. The Division Bell was another concept album, in some ways representing Gilmour's take on the same themes Waters had tackled with The Wall. The title was suggested to Gilmour by his friend Douglas Adams. Many of the lyrics were co-written by Polly Samson, Gilmour's girlfriend at the time, whom he married shortly after the album's release. Besides Samson, the album featured most of the musicians who had joined the A Momentary Lapse of Reason tour, as well as saxophonist Dick Parry, a contributor to the mid-70s Floyd albums. Anthony Moore, who had co-written the lyrics for several songs on the previous album, penned the lyrics for a tune by Wright, \\\"Wearing the Inside Out\\\", Wright's first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd record since Dark Side of The Moon. Wright and Moore's writing collaboration continued on nearly every song on Wright's subsequent solo album, Broken China.  At the end of the tour in support of The Division Bell in1994, Gilmour stopped planning new music and tours for Pink Floyd, and the band went inactive.  The band released a live album entitled P*U*L*S*E in 1995. It hit #1 in U.S. and featured songs recorded during The Division Bell tour, primarily from concerts in London's Earls Court. The Division Bell concerts featured a mix of classic and modern Pink Floyd. The Pulse album has an entire performance of Dark Side of the Moon. VHS and Laserdisc versions of the concert at London's Earls Court 20 October 1994, were also released. A DVD edition was released on 10 July 2006 and quickly topped the charts. The original edition's CD case had an LED, timer IC, and battery which caused a red flash to blink once per second, like a heartbeat.  In 1995, the band received their first and only Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for \\\"Marooned\\\".  On 17 January 1996, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by The Smashing Pumpkins' frontman Billy Corgan. Roger Waters did not attend, still being antagonistic towards his former bandmates. At their acceptance speech, Gilmour - referring to the final verse of Dark Side of the Moon - said, \\\"I'll have to grab a couple more of these for our two band members that started playing different tunes; Roger and Syd...\\\". Although Mason was present to accept the award, he did not join Gilmour and Wright (and Billy Corgan) for their acoustic performance of 'Wish You Were Here'.  1996 saw the release of Richard Wright's second solo album, Broken China, where he collaborated again with lyricist Anthony Moore.  A live recording of The Wall was released in 2000, compiled from the 1980-1981 London concerts, entitled Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980-81. It reached #19 on the American album chart. In 2001, a remastered two-disc set of the band's best-known tracks entitled Echoes was released. Gilmour, Mason, Waters and Wright all collaborated on the editing, sequencing, and song selection of the included tracks. Minor controversy was caused due to the songs seguing into one another non-chronologically, presenting the material out of the context of the original albums. Some of the tracks, such as \\\"Echoes\\\", \\\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\\", \\\"Marooned\\\", and \\\"High Hopes\\\" have had substantial sections removed from them. The album reached #2 on the UK and U.S. charts.  In 2003, an SACD reissue of Dark Side of the Moon was released with new artwork on the front cover. The album was also re-released as an 180 gram, virgin vinyl pressing in 2003, which included all the original album art from the original release of the album, albeit with a new poster. Nick Mason's book, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd was published in 2004 in Europe and 2005 in the U.S. Long-time Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke died on 30 October 2003. Gilmour, Mason and Wright reunited at his funeral and performed \\\"Fat Old Sun\\\" and \\\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\\" in Chichester Cathedral in tribute.  Two years later, on 2 July 2005, the band reunited for a one-off performance at the London Live 8 concert. This time, however, they were joined by Waters -- the first time all four band members were on stage together in 24 years. The band performed a four-song set consisting of \\\"Speak To Me\\/Breathe (Breathe In The Air)\\\", \\\"Money\\\", \\\"Wish You Were Here\\\", and \\\"Comfortably Numb\\\", with both Gilmour and Waters sharing lead vocals. At the end of their performance Gilmour said \\\"thank you very much, good night\\\" and started to walk off the stage. Waters called him back, however, and the band shared a group hug that became one of the most famous images of Live 8.  In the week after Live 8, there was a revival of interest in Pink Floyd. According to record store chain HMV, sales of Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd went up, in the following week, by 1343%, while Amazon.com reported increases in sales of The Wall at 3600%, Wish You Were Here at 2000%, The Dark Side of the Moon at 1400% and Animals at 1000%. David Gilmour subsequently declared that he would donate his share of profits from this sales boom to charity, and urged all the other artists and record companies profiting from Live 8 to do the same. On 16 November 2005 Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend. Gilmour and Mason attended in person, explaining that Wright was in hospital following eye surgery, and Waters appeared on a video screen, from Rome.  David Gilmour released his third solo record, On an Island, on 6 March 2006, and began a tour of small concert venues in Europe, Canada and the U.S. with a band including Richard Wright and other musicians from the post-Waters Pink Floyd tours. Roger Waters was also invited to join the band (along with Nick Mason) in London, but final rehearsals for his 2006 Europe\\/U.S. tour required him to decline. Nonetheless, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason's encore performances of \\\"Wish You Were Here\\\" and \\\"Comfortably Numb\\\" marked the first performance by Pink Floyd since Live 8. Waters was joined on stage by Mason for a few performances of Dark Side of the Moon during his 2006 tour. Wright was also invited to join Waters for the first performance, but Wright refused on the grounds that he had to work on his solo album (which remains unreleased). Waters' worldwide The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour consisted of Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety along with a selection of other Pink Floyd material and a small number of songs from Waters' solo career, although no songs from The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking or Radio K.A.O.S. were included. Waters is reported to be working on a solo album, and there has been talk of him doing a Broadway musical version of The Wall, with other Pink Floyd music to be inserted.  Many fans expressed hope that the band's Live 8 appearance would lead to a reunion tour, and a record-breaking US$250 million deal for a world tour was offered, but the band made it clear that they had no such plans. In the weeks after the show, however, the rifts between the members seemed to have mostly healed. Gilmour confirmed that he and Waters are on \\\"pretty amicable terms\\\". Waters indicated that he would like to play together again not for a whole tour but for a single event, similar to Live 8.  On 31 January 2006, David Gilmour issued a joint statement on behalf of the group stating that they had no plans to reunite, refuting rumours from several media outlets. Gilmour later stated in an interview with La Repubblica that he is finished with Pink Floyd and wishes to focus on solo projects and his family. He mentions that he agreed to play Live 8 with Waters to support the cause, to make peace with Waters, and knowing he would regret not taking part. However, he states that Pink Floyd would be willing to perform for a concert \\\"that would support Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts\\\". Then speaking with Billboard, Gilmour changed his \\\"finished with Pink Floyd\\\" sentiment to \\\"who knows\\\".  2007 saw the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd's signing to EMI and the 40th anniversary of the release of their first three singles \\\"Arnold Layne\\\", \\\"See Emily Play\\\" and \\\"Apples and Oranges\\\" and their debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. This was marked by the release of a limited edition set containing mono and stereo mixes of the albums, plus tracks from the singles and other rare recordings.  On 10 May 2007, Roger Waters performed at the Syd Barrett tribute concert at the Barbican Centre in London. This was then followed by a surprise performance by the post-Waters Pink Floyd line-up of David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason of \\\"Arnold Layne\\\" to a rapturous applause and standing ovation. As it turned out, it would be the final time this configuration of Pink Floyd would ever perform together.  Hopes of a second reunion concert with the band's classic lineup were dashed when Waters did not perform with the group. Roger Waters took to the stage to screams of \\\"Pink Floyd!\\\" to which he responded, \\\"Later.\\\" Gilmour, Mason, and Wright took to the stage for what would be the final time to screams of \\\"Roger Waters!\\\" to which Gilmour politely responded, \\\"Yeah, he was here too, now the rest of us.\\\"  In a January 2007 interview, Waters suggested he had become more open to a Pink Floyd reunion: \\\"I would have no problem if the rest of them wanted to get together. It wouldn't even have to be to save the world. It could be just because it would be fun. And people would love it.\\\"  On 25 September 2007, Gilmour stated that a future reunion of Pink Floyd in any form, be it with or without Roger Waters, looked grim, stating that \\\"I can't see why I would want to be going back to that old thing. It's very retrogressive. I want to look forward, and looking back isn't my joy.\\\"  In December 2007, Pink Floyd released a new CD box set, Oh, By the Way, containing all fourteen studio albums with their newest respective CD remasters, original vinyl artwork plus new artwork from Storm Thorgerson. Mason and Waters had said that they would be happy to do a Pink Floyd tour, but during the BBC1 Special, \\\"Which One's Pink?,\\\" when asked about whether the band would reform, Gilmour ambiguously stated either \\\"Ain't gonna happen\\\" or \\\"Anything could happen\\\". Which of these two phrases were said is debatable. During the same documentary, Wright stated that he \\\"wouldn't mind playing the Pink Floyd 'music' again,\\\" but said nothing solid about reuniting with the actual members.  In a May 2008 interview for BBC 6Music, David Gilmour hinted that he would be in favour of another one-off show, but ruled out a full tour: \\\"Who knows? Who knows the future? I haven't absolutely said 'no' to the possibility but I think that in reality any sort of long-term thing together is not going to happen. We did the one-off thing and that was probably enough for me but we shall see. At my incredibly advantaged age -having achieved this- I've earned the right to sit on my ass for a little while and consider what to do next.\\\" In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to contemporary music. Roger Waters and Nick Mason were present at the ceremony, where they received the prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.  Speaking to Associated Press to promote the release of his new live album, David Gilmour revealed that a reunion \\\"categorically\\\" won't happen. Gilmour said: \\\"The [Live 8] rehearsals were less enjoyable. The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that I've done that. I've been there, I've done it.\\\"  On 15 September 2008, Richard Wright died at age 65. He was lauded by his surviving bandmates, Gilmour in particular, for his influence on the overall sound of Pink Floyd.  In April 2009, it was revealed that the band had initiated legal action against EMI, their label for over four decades, for allegedly failing to pay royalties. The dispute is reportedly connected to an ongoing disagreement with Terra Firma Capital Partners, the private equity firm who took ownership of EMI in 2007.  On 10 July 2010, Roger Waters and David Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation. The event took place at Kidlington in Oxfordshire, England. The pair played to an audience of approximately 200. The event raised money for Palestinian children in order to give them a better life. Gilmour played this event in 2009, when he performed alongside Kate Moss. In return for Waters' appearance at the event, Gilmour has agreed to perform \\\"Comfortably Numb\\\" at one of Waters' upcoming performances of The Wall.  On 12 October 2010, Gilmour released Metallic Spheres, a collaboration with techno group The Orb  In 2011, Roger Waters embarked on a tour of \\\"The Wall\\\". He confirmed that David Gilmour would perform guitar and vocals on \\\"Comfortably Numb\\\" at one of the performances. Gilmour appeared at the 12 May 2011 concert at the O2 Arena in London. Gilmour and Nick Mason joined Waters at the end of the show for a performance of \\\"Outside the Wall\\\"  On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd...?, reissuing the band's back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including special \\\"Immersion\\\" multi-disc multi-format editions. All the albums have been remastered by James Guthrie, the co-producer of The Wall.  On 7 July ]2014, the band announced they would be releasing their fifteenth studio album. \\\"The Endless River\\\". The record uses the 1994 ambient session known as \\\"The Big Spliff\\\" as its basis. The \\\"Big Spliff\\\" recording was expanded upon in recording sessions in 2013 and 2014. The record will feature material recorded by the late Rick Wright for the 1994 session, but will not include Roger Waters. \\\"The Endless River\\\" is slated to be released in October 2014.

They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and musically influential groups in the history of popular music. \\nPink Floyd were founded in 1965 by students Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright. They gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene during the late 1960s, and under Barrett's leadership released two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). David Gilmour joined as a fifth member in December 1967; Barrett left the band in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health exacerbated by drug use. Waters became the band's primary lyricist and, by the mid-1970s, their dominant songwriter, devising the concepts behind their critically and commercially successful albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983). \\nWright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985, declaring it a \\\"spent force\\\". Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd; Wright rejoined them as a session musician and, later, a band member. The three produced two more albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994), and toured until 1994. After nearly two decades of acrimony, Pink Floyd reunited with Waters in 2005 for a performance at the global awareness event Live 8, but Gilmour and Waters have since stated they have no plans to reunite as a band again. Barrett died in 2006 and Wright in 2008. The final Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River, recorded without Waters and based on material recorded in 1993-1994, was released in November 2014. \\nPink Floyd were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. By 2013, the band had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the United States. \\n\\n1963-67: early years:\\n\\nFormation:\\nRoger Waters met drummer Nick Mason while they were both studying architecture at the London Polytechnic at Regent Street. They first played music together in a group formed by Keith Noble and Clive Metcalfe with Noble's sister Sheilagh. Keyboardist Richard Wright, a fellow architecture student, joined later that year, and the group became a sextet named Sigma 6, the first band to include Waters, who was at this time playing lead guitar; Wright, who at first played rhythm guitar since there was rarely an available keyboard; and Mason on drums. The band started performing during private functions, while rehearsing in a tearoom in the basement of the Regent Street Polytechnic. They performed songs by The Searchers and material written by their manager and songwriter, fellow student Ken Chapman. \\nIn September 1963, Waters and Mason moved into a flat at 39 Stanhope Gardens, near Crouch End London, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the nearby Hornsey College of Art and the Regent Street Polytechnic. Mason moved out after the 1964 academic year, and guitarist Bob Klose moved in during September 1964, prompting Waters' switch to bass. Sigma 6 went through a number of other transitory names, including the Meggadeaths, the Abdabs and the Screaming Abdabs, Leonard's Lodgers, and the Spectrum Five before settling on the Tea Set. In 1964, as Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own band, guitarist Syd Barrett joined Klose and Waters at Stanhope Gardens. Barrett, two years younger, had moved to London in 1962 to study at the Camberwell College of Art. Waters and Barrett were childhood friends; Waters had often visited Barrett and watched him play guitar at Barrett's mother's house. Mason said about Barrett: \\\"In a period when everyone was being cool in a very adolescent, self-conscious way, Syd was unfashionably outgoing; my enduring memory of our first encounter is the fact that he bothered to come up and introduce himself to me.\\\" \\nNoble and Metcalfe left the Tea Set in late 1963, and Klose introduced the band to singer Chris Dennis, a technician with the Royal Air Force (RAF). In December 1964, they managed to secure their first recording time, at a studio in West Hampstead, through one of Wright's friends, who let them use some down time for free. Wright, who was taking a break from his studies, did not participate in the session. When the RAF assigned Dennis a post in Bahrain in early 1965, Barrett became the band's frontman. Later that year, they became the resident band at the Countdown Club, near Kensington High Street in London, where from late night until early morning they played three sets of ninety minutes each. During this period, spurred by the group's need to extend their sets in order to minimise song repetition, came the band's \\\"realisation that songs could be extended with lengthy solos\\\", wrote Mason. After pressure from his parents and advice from his college tutors, Klose quit the band in mid-1965 and Barrett took over on lead guitar. The group first referred to themselves as the Pink Floyd Sound in late 1965. Barrett created the name on the spur of the moment when he discovered that another band, also called the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs. The name is derived from the given names of two blues musicians whose Piedmont blues records Barrett had in his collection, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. \\nBy 1966, the group's repertoire consisted mainly of rhythm and blues songs and they had begun to receive paid bookings, including one for a performance at the Marquee Club in March 1966, where Peter Jenner noticed them. A lecturer at the London School of Economics, Jenner was impressed by the sonic effects Barrett and Wright created, and with his business partner and friend Andrew King, he became their manager. The pair had little experience in the music industry and used King's inherited money to set up Blackhill Enterprises, purchasing about \\u00a31,000 worth of new instruments and equipment for the band. It was around this time that Jenner suggested they drop the \\\"Sound\\\" part of their band name, thus becoming the Pink Floyd. Under Jenner and King's guidance, the group became part of London's underground music scene, playing at venues including All Saints Hall and the Marquee. While performing at the Countdown Club, the band had experimented with long instrumental excursions, and they began to expand upon these with rudimentary but visually effective light shows, projected by coloured slides and domestic lights. Jenner and King's social connections helped gain the band prominent coverage in the Financial Times and an article in The Sunday Times which stated: \\\"At the launching of the new magazine IT the other night a pop group called the Pink Floyd played throbbing music while a series of bizarre coloured shapes flashed on a huge screen behind them ... apparently very psychedelic.\\\" \\nIn 1966, they strengthened their business relationship with Blackhill Enterprises, becoming equal partners with Jenner and King and the band members each holding a one-sixth share. By late 1966, their set included fewer R&B standards and more Barrett originals, many of which would be included on their first album. While they had significantly increased the frequency of their performances, the band were not widely accepted at the time. Following a performance at a Catholic youth club, the owner refused to pay them, claiming that their performance wasn't music. When their management filed suit in a small claims court against the owner of the youth organisation, a local magistrate upheld the owner's decision. However, they were much better received at the UFO Club in London, where a small fan base began to build up around the band. Barrett's performances were enthusiastic, \\\"leaping around ... madness ... improvisation ... inspired to get past his limitations and into areas that were ... very interesting. Which none of the others could do\\\", wrote biographer Nicholas Schaffner. \\n\\nSigning with EMI:\\nIn 1967, Pink Floyd began to attract the attention of the mainstream music industry. While in negotiations with record companies, IT co-founder and UFO club manager Joe Boyd and Pink Floyd's booking agent Bryan Morrison arranged for and funded the recording of some songs at Sound Techniques in West Hampstead. Included were the standout track \\\"Arnold Layne\\\" and \\\"Candy and a Currant Bun\\\" as its B-side, both of which they recorded on 29 January 1967. Three days later Pink Floyd signed with EMI, receiving a \\u00a35,000 advance. EMI released the band's first single, \\\"Arnold Layne\\\", on 10 March 1967, on its Columbia label. The song's references to cross-dressing led to a ban by several radio stations; however, some creative manipulation by the retailers who supplied sales figures to the music business meant that the single peaked in the UK at number 20. \\nEMI-Columbia released Pink Floyd's second single, \\\"See Emily Play\\\", on 16 June 1967. It fared slightly better than \\\"Arnold Layne\\\", peaking at number 6 in the UK. They performed on the BBC's Look of the Week, where Waters and Barrett, erudite and engaging, faced tough questioning from Hans Keller. They appeared on the BBC's Top of the Pops, an immensely popular programme that controversially required artists to mime their singing and playing. Though Pink Floyd returned for two more performances, by the third, Barrett had begun to unravel, and it was around this time that the band first noticed significant changes in his behaviour. By early 1967, he was regularly using LSD, and Mason described him as \\\"completely distanced from everything going on\\\". \\n\\nThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn:\\nMorrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, and as part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: \\\"I found Barrett in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, and we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down.\\\" \\nForced to cancel Pink Floyd's appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, as well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused to come out of the car. A stay in Formentera with Sam Hutt, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement. The band followed a few concert dates in Europe during September with their first tour of the US in October. As the US tour went on, Barrett's condition grew steadily worse. During appearances on the Dick Clark and Pat Boone shows in November, Barrett confounded his hosts by not responding to questions and staring off into space. He refused to move his lips when it came time to mime \\\"See Emily Play\\\" on Boone's show. After these embarrassing episodes, King ended their US visit and immediately sent them home to London. Soon after their return, they supported Jimi Hendrix during a tour of England; however, Barrett's depression worsened as the tour continued, reaching a crisis point in December, when the band responded by adding a new member to their lineup. \\n\\n1968-77: transition and international success:\\n\\nGilmour replaces Barrett:\\nIn December 1967, the group added guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member of Pink Floyd. Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied with him at Cambridge Tech in the early 1960s. The two had performed at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France. In 1965, while a member of Joker's Wild, Gilmour had watched the Tea Set. Morrison's assistant, Steve O'Rourke, set Gilmour up in a room at O'Rourke's house with a salary of \\u00a330 per week, and in January 1968, Blackhill Enterprises announced Gilmour as the band's newest member; the second guitarist and its fifth member, the band intending to continue with Barrett as a nonperforming songwriter. Jenner commented: \\\"The idea was that Dave would ... cover for Barrett's eccentricities and when that got to be not workable, Syd was just going to write. Just to try to keep him involved\\\". In an expression of his frustration, Barrett, who was expected to write additional hit singles to follow up \\\"Arnold Layne\\\" and \\\"See Emily Play\\\", instead played the band's \\\"Have You Got It Yet?\\\", intentionally changing the structure on each performance so as to make the song impossible to follow and learn. In a January 1968 photo-shoot of the five-man Pink Floyd, the photographs show Barrett looking detached from the others, staring into the distance. \\nWorking with Barrett eventually proved too difficult, and matters came to a head in January while en route to a performance in Southampton when a band member asked if they should collect Barrett. According to Gilmour, the answer was \\\"Nah, let's not bother\\\", signalling the end of Barrett's tenure with Pink Floyd. Waters later admitted, \\\"He was our friend, but most of the time we now wanted to strangle him\\\". In early March 1968, Pink Floyd met with business partners Jenner and King to discuss the band's future; Barrett agreed to leave. \\nJenner and King believed Barrett to be the creative genius of the band, and decided to represent him and end their relationship with Pink Floyd. Morrison then sold his business to NEMS Enterprises, and O'Rourke became the band's personal manager. Blackhill announced Barrett's departure on 6 April 1968. After Barrett's departure, the burden of lyrical composition and creative direction fell mostly on Waters. Initially, Gilmour mimed to Barrett's voice on the group's European TV appearances; however, while playing on the university circuit, they avoided Barrett songs in favour of Waters and Wright material such as \\\"It Would Be So Nice\\\" and \\\"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\\\". \\n\\nA Saucerful of Secrets:\\n\\nIn 1968, Pink Floyd returned to Abbey Road Studios to record their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets. The LP included Barrett's final contribution to their discography, \\\"Jugband Blues\\\". Waters began to develop his own songwriting, contributing \\\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\\", \\\"Let There Be More Light\\\" and \\\"Corporal Clegg\\\". Wright composed \\\"See-Saw\\\" and \\\"Remember a Day\\\". Smith encouraged them to self-produce their music, and they recorded demos of new material at their houses. With Smith's instruction at Abbey Road, they learned how to use the recording studio to realise their artistic vision. However, Smith remained unconvinced by their music, and when Mason struggled to perform his drum part on \\\"Remember a Day\\\", Smith stepped in as his replacement. Wright recalled Smith's attitude about the sessions, \\\"Norman gave up on the second album ... he was forever saying things like, 'You can't do twenty minutes of this ridiculous noise.'\\\" As neither Waters nor Mason could read music, to illustrate the structure of the album's title track, they invented their own system of notation. Gilmour later described their method as looking \\\"like an architectural diagram\\\". \\nReleased in June 1968, the album featured a psychedelic cover designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. The first of several Pink Floyd album covers designed by Hipgnosis, it was the second time that EMI permitted one of their groups to contract designers for an album jacket. The release peaked at number 9, spending 11 weeks on the UK chart.Record Mirror gave the album an overall favourable review, but urged listeners to \\\"forget it as background music to a party\\\".John Peel described a live performance of the title track as \\\"like a religious experience\\\", while NME described the song as \\\"long and boring ... with little to warrant its monotonous direction\\\". On the day after the album's UK release, Pink Floyd performed at the first ever free concert in Hyde Park. In July 1968, they returned to the US for a second visit. Accompanied by the Soft Machine and the Who, it marked Pink Floyd's first significant tour. In December of that year, they released \\\"Point Me at the Sky\\\"; no more successful than the two singles they had released since \\\"See Emily Play\\\", it would be the band's last until their 1973 release, \\\"Money\\\". \\n\\nUmmagumma, Atom Heart Mother, and Meddle:\\n\\nUmmagumma represented a departure from their previous work. Released as a double-LP on EMI's Harvest label, the first two sides contained live performances recorded at Manchester College of Commerce and Mothers, a club in Birmingham. The second LP contained a single experimental contribution from each band member.Ummagumma received positive reviews upon its release, in November 1969. The album peaked at number 5, spending 21 weeks on the UK chart. \\nIn October 1970, Pink Floyd released Atom Heart Mother. An early version premi\\u00e8red in France in January, but disagreements over the mix prompted the hiring of Ron Geesin to work out the sound issues. Geesin worked to improve the score, but with little creative input from the band, production was troublesome. Geesin eventually completed the project with the aid of John Alldis, who was the director of the choir hired to perform on the record. Smith earned an executive producer credit, and the album marked his final official contribution to the band's discography. Gilmour said it was \\\"A neat way of saying that he didn't ... do anything\\\". Waters was critical of Atom Heart Mother, claiming that he would prefer if it were \\\"thrown into the dustbin and never listened to by anyone ever again.\\\" Gilmour was equally dismissive of the album and once described it as \\\"a load of rubbish\\\", stating: \\\"I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period.\\\" Pink Floyd's first number 1 album, Atom Heart Mother was hugely successful in Britain, spending 18 weeks on the UK chart. It premi\\u00e8red at the Bath Festival on 27 June 1970. \\nPink Floyd toured extensively across America and Europe in 1970. In 1971, Pink Floyd took second place in a reader's poll, in Melody Maker, and for the first time were making a profit. Mason and Wright became fathers and bought homes in London while Gilmour, still single, moved to a 19th-century farm in Essex. Waters installed a home recording studio at his house in Islington in a converted toolshed at the back of his garden. \\n\\nIn January 1971, upon their return from touring Atom Heart Mother, Pink Floyd began working on new material. Lacking a central theme, they attempted several unproductive experiments; engineer John Leckie described the sessions as often beginning in the afternoon and ending early the next morning, \\\"during which time nothing would get accomplished. There was no record company contact whatsoever, except when their label manager would show up now and again with a couple of bottles of wine and a couple of joints.\\\" The band spent long periods working on basic sounds, or a guitar riff. They also spent several days at Air Studios, attempting to create music using a variety of household objects, a project which would be revisited between The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. \\nReleased in October 1971, \\\"Meddle not only confirms lead guitarist David Gilmour's emergence as a real shaping force with the group, it states forcefully and accurately that the group is well into the growth track again\\\" wrote Jean-Charles Costa of Rolling Stone.NME called Meddle \\\"an exceptionally good album\\\", singling out \\\"Echoes\\\" as the \\\"Zenith which the Floyd have been striving for.\\\" However, Melody Maker's Michael Watts found it underwhelming, calling the album \\\"a soundtrack to a non-existent movie\\\", and shrugging off Pink Floyd as \\\"so much sound and fury, signifying nothing.\\\"Meddle is a transitional album between the Barrett-influenced group of the late 1960s and the emerging Pink Floyd. The LP peaked at number 3, spending 82 weeks on the UK chart. \\n\\nThe Dark Side of the Moon:\\n\\nPink Floyd recorded The Dark Side of the Moon between May 1972 and January 1973, with EMI staff engineer Alan Parsons at Abbey Road. The title is an allusion to lunacy rather than astronomy. The band had composed and refined the material on Dark Side while touring the UK, Japan, North America and Europe. Producer Chris Thomas assisted Parsons. Hipgnosis designed the album's packaging, which included George Hardie's iconic refracting prism design on the cover. Thorgerson's Dark Side album cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The resulting refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity. Waters is the sole author of the album's lyrics. \\nReleased in March 1973, the LP became an instant chart success in the UK and throughout Western Europe, earning an enthusiastic response from critics. Each member of Pink Floyd except Wright boycotted the press release of The Dark Side of the Moon because a quadraphonic mix had not yet been completed, and they felt presenting the album through a poor-quality stereo PA system was insufficient.Melody Maker\\u200d\\u200a'\\u200bs Roy Hollingworth described side one as \\\"utterly confused ... and difficult to follow\\\", but praised side two, writing: \\\"The songs, the sounds ... and the rhythms were solid ... the saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled\\\".Rolling Stone\\u200d\\u200a'\\u200bs Loyd Grossman described it as \\\"a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement.\\\" \\n\\nThroughout March 1973, The Dark Side of the Moon featured as part of Pink Floyd's US tour. The album is one of the most commercially successful rock albums of all time; a US number 1, it remained on the Billboard chart for more than fourteen years, selling more than 40 million copies worldwide. In Britain, the album peaked at number 2, spending 364 weeks on the UK chart.Dark Side is the world's second best-selling album, and the twenty-first best-selling album of all time in the US. The success of the album brought enormous wealth to the members of Pink Floyd. Waters and Wright bought large country houses while Mason became a collector of expensive cars. Disenchanted with their US record company, Capitol Records, Pink Floyd and O'Rourke negotiated a new contract with Columbia Records, who gave them a reported advance of $1,000,000, which is worth approximately $5,000,000 today. In Europe, they continued to be represented by Harvest Records. \\n\\nWish You Were Here:\\n\\nAfter a tour of the UK performing Dark Side, Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975 and began work on their ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here. Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with the Alan Parsons Project, and so the band turned to Brian Humphries. Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of The Dark Side of the Moon had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained. Wright later described these early sessions as \\\"falling within a difficult period\\\" and Waters found them \\\"torturous\\\". Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming. \\nDespite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks. During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate. Waters commented: \\\"Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... that indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd.\\\" \\nWhile Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio, during which Thorgerson recalled that he \\\"sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there.\\\" He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him. Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience. Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth. Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US. \\n\\nAnimals:\\n\\nIn 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington, and began converting the building into a recording studio and storage space. In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals, in their newly finished 24-track studio. The concept of Animals originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell's political fable, Animal Farm. The album's lyrics described different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging of Animals; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of a pig. \\nThe division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for \\\"Dogs\\\", which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part \\\"Pigs on the Wing\\\". Wright commented: \\\"It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material ... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there.\\\" Mason recalled: \\\"Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately.\\\" Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering.Animals is the first Pink Floyd album that does not include a writing credit for Wright, who commented: \\\"Animals... wasn't a fun record to make ... this was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band ... that it was only because of him that we were still going ... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me.\\\" \\nReleased in January 1977, the album peaked on the UK chart at number two, and the US chart at number three.NME described the album as \\\"one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright iconoclastic hunks of music\\\", and Melody Maker\\u200d\\u200a'\\u200bs Karl Dallas called it \\\"an uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific\\\". \\nThey performed much of the album's material during their \\\"In the Flesh\\\" tour, Pink Floyd's first experience playing large stadiums, the size of which caused unease in the band. Waters began arriving at each venue alone, departing immediately after the performance. On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to leave the band. At the Montreal Olympic Stadium, a group of noisy and enthusiastic fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters so much that he spat at one of them. The end of the tour marked a low point for Gilmour, who felt that the band achieved the success they had sought, with nothing left for them to accomplish. \\n\\n1978-85: Waters-led era:\\n\\nThe Wall:\\nIn July 1978, amid a financial turmoil caused by negligent investments, Waters presented the group with two original ideas for their next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall, and the other would later become Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former to be their next album.Bob Ezrin co-produced, and he wrote a forty-page script for the new album. Ezrin based the story on the central figure of Pink--a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was the death of his father in World War II. This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person. \\nDuring the recording of The Wall, Waters, Gilmour and Mason became increasingly dissatisfied with Wright's lack of contribution to the album. Gilmour said that Wright \\\"hadn't contributed anything of any value whatsoever to the album--he did very, very little\\\" and that is why he \\\"got the boot\\\". According to Mason, \\\"Rick's contribution was to turn up and sit in on the sessions without doing anything, just 'being a producer'.\\\" Waters commented: \\\"Wright was not prepared to cooperate in making the record ... and it was agreed by everybody ... either he can have a long battle or he can agree to ... finish making the album, keep his full share ... but at the end of it he would leave quietly. Rick agreed.\\\" \\nAlthough Pink Floyd had not released a single since 1973's \\\"Money\\\", \\\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)\\\" supported the album, topping the charts in the US and the UK. Released on 30 November 1979, The Wall topped the Billboard chart in the US for fifteen weeks, reaching number three in the UK.The Wall ranks number three on the RIAA's list of the all-time Top 100 albums, with 23 million certified units sold in the US. The cover is one of their most minimalist designs, with a stark white brick wall, and no trademark or band name. It was also their first album cover since The Piper at the Gates of Dawn not designed by Hipgnosis. \\nGerald Scarfe produced a series of animations for the subsequent live shows, The Wall Tour. He also commissioned the construction of large inflatable puppets representing characters from the storyline including the \\\"Mother\\\", the \\\"Ex-wife\\\" and the \\\"Schoolmaster\\\". Pink Floyd used the puppets during their performances of the album. Relationships within the band were at an all-time low; their four Winnebagos parked in a circle, the doors facing away from the centre. Waters used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue and stayed in different hotels from the rest of the band. Wright returned as a paid musician and was the only one of the four to profit from the venture, which lost about $600,000. \\nThe Wall concept also spawned a film, the original idea for which was to be a combination of live concert footage and animated scenes. However, the concert footage proved impractical to film. Alan Parker agreed to direct and took a different approach. The animated sequences would remain, but scenes would be acted by professional actors with no dialogue. Waters was screen-tested, but quickly discarded and they asked Bob Geldof to accept the role of Pink. Geldof was initially dismissive, condemning The Wall\\u200d\\u200a'\\u200bs storyline as \\\"bollocks\\\". Eventually won over by the prospect of participation in a significant film and receiving a large payment for his work, Geldof agreed. Screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1982, Pink Floyd - The Wall premi\\u00e8red in the UK in July 1982. \\n\\nThe Final Cut:\\nIn 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project for the band, with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd - The Wall; however, with the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed artistic direction and began writing new material. Waters saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and he dedicated the new album to his late father. Immediately there were arguments between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycling a number of songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire.Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions. \\nThough Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented, \\\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\\"Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning masterpiece\\\". Loder viewed The Final Cut as \\\"essentially a Roger Waters solo album\\\". \\n\\n\\\"A spent force\\\" and Waters' departure:\\nGilmour had recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and he used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics; from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985. \\nFollowing the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, and this angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. Waters terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract--which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended--and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. Waters then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \\\"a spent force creatively.\\\" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour responded by issuing a carefully worded press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist. He later told The Sunday Times: \\\"Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him\\\". \\n\\n1986-95: Gilmour-led era:\\n\\nA Momentary Lapse of Reason:\\n\\nIn 1987, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason. There were legal obstacles to Wright's readmittance to the band; however, after a meeting in Hampstead Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions. Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence, \\\"would make us stronger legally and musically\\\"; Pink Floyd employed him as a paid musician with weekly earnings of $11,000. Recording sessions for the album began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria, moored along the River Thames. Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, eventually choosing Anthony Moore to write the album's lyrics. Gilmour would later admit that the project was difficult without Waters' creative direction. Mason, concerned that he was too out of practice to perform on the album, made use of session musicians to complete many of the drum parts. He instead busied himself with the album's sound effects. \\nThe album was released in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut, designed the album cover. In order to drive home the point that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle. The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: \\\"I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... and Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate.\\\" Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: \\\"Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at all.\\\"Q Magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo effort. \\nWaters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lack of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice. Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured throughout North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig. Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained the right to use the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall. \\n\\nThe Division Bell:\\n\\nFor several years Pink Floyd had busied themselves with personal pursuits, such as filming and competing in the La Carrera Panamericana and recording a soundtrack for a film based on the event. In January 1993, they began working on a new album, returning to Britannia Row Studios, where for several days, Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, ad-libbing material. After about two weeks, the band had enough ideas to begin creating songs. Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production moved to the Astoria, where from February to May 1993, they worked on about twenty-five ideas. \\nContractually, Wright was not a member of the band; he commented: \\\"It came close to a point where I wasn't going to do the album\\\". However, he earned five co-writing credits on the album, his first on a Pink Floyd album since 1975's Wish You Were Here. Another songwriter credited on the album was Gilmour's future wife, Polly Samson. She helped him write several tracks, including, \\\"High Hopes\\\", a collaborative arrangement which, though initially tense, \\\"pulled the whole album together\\\" commented Ezrin. They hired Michael Kamen to arrange the album's orchestral parts; Dick Parry and Chris Thomas also returned. Writer Douglas Adams provided the album title and Thorgerson the cover artwork. Thorgerson drew inspiration for the album cover from the Moai monoliths of Easter Island; two opposing faces forming an implied third face about which he commented: \\\"the absent face--the ghost of Pink Floyd's past, Syd and Roger\\\". Eager to avoid competing against other album releases, as had happened with A Momentary Lapse, Pink Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would resume touring. The album reached number 1 in both the UK and the US. It spent 51 weeks on the UK chart. \\nPink Floyd spent more than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California, before opening on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost identical road crew to that used for their Momentary Lapse of Reason tour. They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety. The tour ended on 29 October 1994, with the final performance of the last Pink Floyd tour so far. \\n\\n2005-present: reunion, deaths and final album:\\n\\nLive 8 reunion:\\nSee also: Live 8\\n\\nOn 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd for the first time in more than 24 years, at the Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park. Organiser Bob Geldof arranged the reunion, having called Mason earlier in the year to explore the possibility of their reuniting for the event. Geldof asked Gilmour, who turned down the offer, and then asked Mason to intercede on his behalf. Mason declined, but contacted Waters who was immediately enthusiastic. Waters then called Geldof to discuss the event, scheduled to take place in one month. About two weeks later Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day the latter agreed. Gilmour then contacted Wright who immediately agreed. In their statement to the press, they stressed the unimportance of the band's problems in the context of the Live 8 event. \\nThey planned their setlist at the Connaught Hotel in London, followed by three days of rehearsals at Black Island Studios. The sessions were problematic, with minor disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order decided on the eve of the event. At the beginning of their performance, Waters told the audience: \\\"It is quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these years, standing to be counted with the rest of you ... we're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd.\\\" At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage. Waters then called him back, and the band shared a group hug. Images of that hug were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8. Waters commented on their almost twenty years of animosity: \\\"I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit ... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity.\\\" \\nThough Pink Floyd turned down a contract worth \\u00a3136 million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting it ought to be for a charity event only. However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen, stating: \\\"The Live 8 rehearsals convinced me that it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of ... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just ... I've been there, I've done it.\\\" In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed by Gino Castaldo from the Italian newspaper La Repubblica; the resulting article declared: \\\"Patience for fans in mourning. The news is official. Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased.\\\" When asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: \\\"The band? It's over ... I've had enough. I'm 60 years old ... and it is much more comfortable to work on my own.\\\" Since then, both Gilmour and Waters have repeatedly insisted that they have no plans to reunite with the surviving former members. \\n\\nDeaths of Barrett and Wright:\\nBarrett died on 7 July 2006, at his home in Cambridge, aged 60. His family interred him at Cambridge Crematorium on 18 July 2006; no Pink Floyd members attended. After Barrett's death, Wright commented: \\\"The band are very naturally upset and sad to hear of Syd Barrett's death. Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire.\\\" Although Barrett had faded into obscurity over the previous 35 years, the national press praised him for his contributions to music. On 10 May 2007, Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed during a Barrett tribute concert at the Barbican Centre in London. Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed the Barrett compositions, \\\"Bike\\\" and \\\"Arnold Layne\\\", and Waters performed a solo version of his song \\\"Flickering Flame\\\". \\nWright died of an undisclosed form of cancer on 15 September 2008, aged 65. His surviving former bandmates praised him for his influence on the sound of Pink Floyd. \\n\\nFurther performances and re-releases:\\nOn 10 July 2010, Waters and Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation. The event, which raised money for Palestinian children, took place at Kiddington Hall in Oxfordshire, England, where they played to an audience of approximately 200. In return for Waters' appearance at the event, Gilmour agreed to perform \\\"Comfortably Numb\\\" at one of Waters' upcoming performances of The Wall. On 12 May 2011, at The O2 Arena in London, Gilmour honoured his commitment to Waters. Gilmour sang the first and second chorus and played the two guitar solos. Near the end of the show, after the wall had fallen down, Waters said to the crowd: \\\"So now we know tonight was the night when David did me the enormous honour of coming to play 'Comfortably Numb'. So, please welcome David Gilmour! ... By a strange and extraordinary, happy coincidence, there is another remnant of our old band here tonight. Please welcome Mr. Nick Mason to the stage!\\\" Gilmour and Mason, with respectively a mandolin and a tambourine, joined Waters and the rest of his band for \\\"Outside the Wall\\\". \\nOn 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd...?, reissuing the band's back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including \\\"Experience\\\" and \\\"Immersion\\\" multi-disc multi-format editions. James Guthrie, co-producer of The Wall, remastered the albums. \\n\\nThe Endless River:\\n\\nIn 2012, Gilmour and Mason decided to revisit recordings made with Wright, mainly during the Division Bell sessions, to create a new Pink Floyd album. They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and \\\"generally harness studio technology\\\". Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: \\\"I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound. Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was.\\\" Waters was not involved. \\nSamson announced The Endless River in July 2014 on Twitter. Details were announced on Pink Floyd's website on 7 July, describing it as \\\"mainly ambient\\\" and instrumental music. It was released 7 November 2014; it is the second Pink Floyd album distributed by Parlophone following the release of the 20th anniversary editions of The Division Bell earlier in 2014. It became the most pre-ordered album of all time on Amazon UK,and debuted at number one in several countries.The vinyl edition was the fastest-selling UK vinyl release of 2014 and the fastest-selling since 1997.The album received mixed reviews. \\nGilmour stated that The Endless River is Pink Floyd's last album, saying: \\\"I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ... It's a shame, but this is the end.\\\" There was no tour to support the album, as Gilmour said it was \\\"kind of impossible\\\" without Wright. \\n\\nMusicianship:\\n\\nGenres:\\nConsidered one of the UK's first psychedelic music groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene. Some categorise their work from that era as a space rock. According to Rolling Stone: \\\"By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that touched on hard rock, blues, country, folk, and electronic music.\\\" Released in 1968, the song \\\"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\\\" helped galvanise their reputation as an art rock group. Critics also describe them as an acid rock band. By the late 1960s, the press had begun to label their music progressive rock. O'Neill Surber comments on the music of Pink Floyd: \\n\\nRarely will you find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or predictable three-chord blues progressions; and never will you find them spending much time on the usual pop pablum of romance, partying, or self-hype. Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging ... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often seems to have a life of its own ... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance. \\n\\nIn 1968, Wright commented on Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: \\\"It's hard to see why we were cast as the first British psychedelic group. We never saw ourselves that way ... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun ... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted ... the emphasis ... is firmly on spontaneity and improvisation.\\\" Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: \\\"There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental'... Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't want to go back to playing \\\"Interstellar Overdrive\\\" for hours and hours.\\\" Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s. \\n\\nGilmour's guitar work:\\n\\n\\\"While Waters was Floyd's lyricist and conceptualist, Gilmour was the band's voice and its main instrumental focus.\\\" \\n\\n--Alan di Perna, in Guitar World, May 2006\\n\\nCritic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar work as an integral element of Pink Floyd's sound.Rolling Stone ranked Gilmour number 14 in their \\\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\\" list and di Perna described him as the most important guitarist of the 1970s, calling him \\\"the missing link between Hendrix and Van Halen.\\\" In 2006, Gilmour commented on his playing technique: \\\"My fingers make a distinctive sound ... they aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable ... The way I play melodies is connected to things like Hank Marvin and the Shadows\\\". Gilmour's ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to jazz trumpeter Miles Davis. \\nIn 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown described Gilmour's guitar style as \\\"characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures.\\\" According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on \\\"Money\\\", \\\"Time\\\" and \\\"Comfortably Numb\\\" \\\"cut through the mix like a laser beam through fog.\\\" Brown described the \\\"Time\\\" solo as \\\"a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development ... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato.\\\" Brown described Gilmour's sense of phrasing as intuitive, singling it out as perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: \\\"I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting ... to get singing sustain ... you need to play loud -- at or near the feedback threshold. It's just so much more fun to play ... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade.\\\" \\n\\nSonic experimentation:\\nThroughout their career, Pink Floyd experimented with their sound. Their second single, \\\"See Emily Play\\\" premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 12 May 1967. During the performance, the group first used an early quadraphonic device called an Azimuth Co-ordinator. The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, to manipulate the band's amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect. In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system. \\nWaters experimented with the EMS Synthi A and VCS 3 synthesisers on Pink Floyd pieces such as \\\"On the Run\\\", \\\"Welcome to the Machine\\\", and \\\"In the Flesh?\\\". He used a Binson Echorec 2 echo effect on his bass-guitar track for \\\"One of These Days\\\". \\nPink Floyd used innovative sound effects and state of the art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut. Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect. The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones. The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears. \\n\\nFilm scores:\\nPink Floyd also composed several film scores, starting in 1968, with The Committee. In 1969, they recorded the score for Barbet Schroeder's film More. The soundtrack proved beneficial; not only did it pay well but, along with A Saucerful of Secrets, the material they created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter. While composing the soundtrack for director Michelangelo Antonioni's film Zabriskie Point, the band stayed at a luxury hotel in Rome for almost a month. Waters claimed that, without Antonioni's constant changes to the music, they would have completed the work in less than a week. Eventually he used only three of their recordings. One of the pieces turned down by Antonioni, called \\\"The Violent Sequence\\\", later became \\\"Us and Them\\\", included on 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon. In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film La Vall\\u00e9e, for which they released a soundtrack album called Obscured by Clouds. They composed the material in about a week at the Ch\\u00e2teau d'H\\u00e9rouville near Paris, and upon its release, it became Pink Floyd's first album to break into the top 50 on the US Billboard chart. \\n\\nLive performances:\\n\\nRegarded as pioneers of live music performance and renowned for their lavish stage shows, Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, making use of innovative sound effects and quadraphonic speaker systems. From their earliest days, they employed visual effects to accompany their psychedelic rock music while performing at venues such as the UFO Club in London. Their slide-and-light show was one of the first in British rock, and it helped them became popular among London's underground. \\nTo celebrate the launch of the London Free School's magazine International Times in 1966, they performed in front of 2,000 people at the opening of the Roundhouse, attended by celebrities including Paul McCartney and Marianne Faithfull. In mid-1966, road manager Peter Wynne-Willson joined their road crew, and updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas including the use of polarisers, mirrors and stretched condoms. After their record deal with EMI, Pink Floyd purchased a Ford Transit van, then considered extravagant band transportation. On 29 April 1967, they headlined an all-night event called The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream at the Alexandra Palace, London. Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at around three o'clock in the morning after a long journey by van and ferry from the Netherlands, taking the stage just as the sun was beginning to rise. In July 1969, precipitated by their space-related music and lyrics, they took part in the live BBC television coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing, performing an instrumental piece which they called \\\"Moonhead\\\". \\nIn November 1974, they employed for the first time the large circular screen that would become a staple of their live shows. In 1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named \\\"Algie\\\". Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience, would explode with a loud noise during the In the Flesh Tour. The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album The Wall. The subsequent The Wall Tour featured a 40 feet (12 m) high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience. They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes from the story. They commissioned the creation of several giant inflatables to represent characters from the story. One striking feature of the tour was the performance of \\\"Comfortably Numb\\\". While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue on top of the wall. When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly reveal him. Gilmour stood on a flightcase on castors, an insecure setup supported from behind by a technician. A large hydraulic platform supported both Gilmour and the tech. \\nDuring the Division Bell Tour, an unknown person using the name Publius posted a message on an internet newsgroup inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. White lights in front of the stage at the Pink Floyd concert in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court on 20 October 1994, someone projected the word \\\"enigma\\\" in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that their record company had instigated the Publius Enigma mystery, rather than the band. \\n\\nLyrical themes:\\nMarked by Waters' philosophical lyrics, Rolling Stone described Pink Floyd as \\\"purveyors of a distinctively dark vision\\\". Author Jere O'Neill Surber wrote: \\\"their interests are truth and illusion, life and death, time and space, causality and chance, compassion and indifference.\\\" Waters identified empathy as a central theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd. Author George Reisch described Meddle\\u200d\\u200d\\u200a'\\u200b\\u200ds psychedelic opus, \\\"Echoes\\\", as \\\"built around the core idea of genuine communication, sympathy, and collaboration with others.\\\" Despite having been labeled \\\"the gloomiest man in rock\\\", author Deena Weinstein described Waters as an existentialist, dismissing the unfavourable moniker as the result of misinterpretation by music critics. \\n\\nDisillusionment, absence, and non-being:\\nWaters' lyrics to Wish You Were Here\\u200d\\u200d\\u200a'\\u200b\\u200ds \\\"Have a Cigar\\\" deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives. The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes \\\"Pink\\\" is the name of one of the band members. According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the \\\"dehumanizing aspects of the world of commerce\\\", a situation the artist must endure in order to reach their audience. \\nAbsence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War. Waters' lyrics also explored unrealized political goals and unsuccessful endeavors. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with aging. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: \\\"The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling.\\\" Waters commented: \\\"it's about none of us really being there ... it should have been called Wish We Were Here\\\". \\nO'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to \\\"Comfortably Numb\\\": \\\"I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone.\\\" Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, \\\"Jugband Blues\\\": \\\"I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here.\\\" \\n\\nExploitation and oppression:\\nAuthor Patrick Croskery described Animals as a unique blend of the \\\"powerful sounds and suggestive themes\\\" of Dark Side with The Wall\\u200d\\u200d\\u200a'\\u200b\\u200ds portrayal of artistic alienation. He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm.Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: \\\"If you didn't care what happened to me. And I didn't care for you\\\", then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphized characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each. The lyrics ultimately paint a picture of dystopia, the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines. \\nThe album's characters include the \\\"Dogs\\\", representing fervent capitalists, the \\\"Pigs\\\", symbolizing political corruption, and the \\\"Sheep\\\", who represent the exploited. Croskery described the \\\"Sheep\\\" as being in a \\\"state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity\\\", a false consciousness. The \\\"Dog\\\", in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone with no one to trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation. Waters used Mary Whitehouse as an example of a \\\"Pig\\\"; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society. At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: \\\"You know that I care what happens to you. And I know that you care for me too.\\\" However, he also acknowledges that the \\\"Pigs\\\" are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a \\\"Dog\\\" who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them. \\n\\nAlienation, war, and insanity:\\n\\n\\\"When I say, 'I'll see you on the dark side of the moon'... what I mean is ... If you feel that you're the only one ... that you seem crazy because you think everything is crazy, you're not alone.\\\" \\n\\n--Waters, quoted in Harris, 2005\\n\\nO'Neill Surber compared the lyrics of Dark Side\\u200d\\u200d\\u200a'\\u200b\\u200ds \\\"Brain Damage\\\" with Karl Marx\\u200d\\u200d\\u200a'\\u200b\\u200ds theory of self-alienation; \\\"there's someone in my head, but it's not me.\\\" The lyrics to Wish You Were Here\\u200d\\u200d\\u200a'\\u200b\\u200ds \\\"Welcome to the Machine\\\" suggest what Marx called the alienation of the thing; the song's protagonist preoccupied with material possessions to the point that he becomes estranged from himself and others. Allusions to the alienation of man's species being can be found in Animals; the \\\"Dog\\\" reduced to living instinctively as a non-human. The \\\"Dogs\\\" become alienated from themselves to the extent that they justify their lack of integrity as a \\\"necessary and defensible\\\" position in \\\"a cutthroat world with no room for empathy or moral principle\\\" wrote Detmer.Alienation from others is a consistent theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd, and it is a core element of The Wall. \\nWar, viewed as the most severe consequence of the manifestation of alienation from others, is also a core element of The Wall, and a recurring theme in the band's music. Waters' father died in combat during the Second World War, and his lyrics often alluded to the cost of war, including those from \\\"Corporal Clegg\\\" (1968), \\\"Free Four\\\" (1972), \\\"Us and Them\\\" (1973), \\\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\\" and \\\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\\" from The Final Cut (1983), an album dedicated to his late father and subtitled A Requiem for the Postwar Dream. The themes and composition of The Wall express Waters' upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War, a condition that negatively affected his personal relationships with women. \\nWaters' lyrics to The Dark Side of the Moon dealt with the pressures of modern life and how those pressures can sometimes cause insanity. He viewed the album's explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal condition. However, Waters also wanted the album to communicate positivity, calling it \\\"an exhortation ... to embrace the positive and reject the negative.\\\" Reisch described The Wall as \\\"less about the experience of madness than the habits, institutions, and social structures that create or cause madness.\\\"The Wall\\u200d\\u200d\\u200a'\\u200b\\u200ds protagonist, Pink, is unable to deal with the circumstances of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making. After he completes his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is \\\"crazy, over the rainbow\\\". He then considers the possibility that his condition may be his own fault: \\\"have I been guilty all this time?\\\" Realizing his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has let everyone down, his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him. He then stands trial for \\\"showing feelings of an almost human nature\\\", further exacerbating his alienation of species being. As with the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault, Waters' lyrics suggest Pink's insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, \\\"custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies\\\", contribute to his angst, according to Reisch. \\n\\nRecognition and influence:\\n\\nPink Floyd are one of the most commercially successful and influential rock bands of all time. They have sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the United States, and 37.9 million albums sold in the US since 1993. The Sunday Times Rich List, Music Millionaires 2013 (UK), ranked Waters at number 12 with an estimated fortune of \\u00a3150 million, Gilmour at number 27 with \\u00a385 million and Mason at number 37 with \\u00a350 million. \\nIn 2004, MSNBC ranked Pink Floyd number 8 on their list of \\\"The 10 Best Rock Bands Ever\\\".Rolling Stone ranked them number 51 on their list of \\\"The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time\\\".Q named Pink Floyd as the biggest band of all time.VH1 ranked them number 18 in the list of the \\\"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\\\".Colin Larkin ranked Pink Floyd number 3 in his list of the 'Top 50 Artists of All Time', a ranking based on the cumulative votes for each artist's albums included in his All Time Top 1000 Albums. \\nPink Floyd have won several awards, including a \\\"Best Engineered Non-Classical Album\\\" Grammy in 1980 for The Wall, and a BAFTA award for \\\"Best Original Song\\\" in 1982 for \\\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\\\" from The Wall film. In 1995, they won a Grammy for best \\\"Rock Instrumental Performance\\\" for \\\"Marooned\\\". In 2008, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden presented Pink Floyd with the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to modern music; Waters and Mason attended the ceremony and accepted the award. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2010. \\nThe music of Pink Floyd influenced numerous artists; David Bowie called Barrett a significant inspiration, and The Edge of U2 bought his first delay pedal after hearing the opening guitar chords to \\\"Dogs\\\" from Animals. Other bands who cite Pink Floyd as an influence include Queen, Tool, Radiohead, Kraftwerk, Marillion, Queensr\\u00ffche, Nine Inch Nails, the Orb and the Smashing Pumpkins. \\nPink Floyd were also admirers of the Monty Python comedy group, and helped finance their 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\",\"site\":\"wikipedia\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Pink_Floyd\",\"license\":{\"type\":\"cc-by-sa\",\"attribution\":\"wikipedia\",\"attribution-url\":\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Pink_Floyd\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-sa\\/3.0\\/\",\"version\":\"3.0\"}}],\"years_active\":[{\"start\":1965,\"end\":1994},{\"start\":2013,\"end\":2014},{\"start\":2015}],\"video\":[{\"title\":\"Pink Floyd - \\\"Time\\\" - HQ\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.dailymotion.com\\/video\\/x2uoqql_pink-floyd-time-hq_music\",\"site\":\"dailymotion.com\",\"date_found\":\"2015-06-30T00:00:00\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/s1.dmcdn.net\\/Latl4.jpg\",\"id\":\"48f5af740c97fc664f7249d861c95a4f\"},{\"title\":\"Pink Floyd - Money (Live)\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.dailymotion.com\\/video\\/x2uhzus_pink-floyd-money-live_music\",\"site\":\"dailymotion.com\",\"date_found\":\"2015-06-30T00:00:00\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/s1.dmcdn.net\\/LX_z6.jpg\",\"id\":\"a1bc4106d77a630ff0ace0cc3cdee2c0\"},{\"title\":\"Pink Floyd - Pigs (Three Different Ones)\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.dailymotion.com\\/video\\/x2uiigt_pink-floyd-pigs-three-different-ones_music\",\"site\":\"dailymotion.com\",\"date_found\":\"2015-06-30T00:00:00\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/s2.dmcdn.net\\/LYMiy.jpg\",\"id\":\"d53073846747ae9a6131c134f3ca9289\"},{\"title\":\"pink floyd arnold layne\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.dailymotion.com\\/video\\/x2unqm3_pink-floyd-arnold-layne_music\",\"site\":\"dailymotion.com\",\"date_found\":\"2015-06-30T00:00:00\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/s1.dmcdn.net\\/LaRma.jpg\",\"id\":\"173ef056b359ea89baff0184155aac01\"},{\"title\":\"Wish you were here (Pink Floyd cover)\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.dailymotion.com\\/video\\/x2v6gmj_wish-you-were-here-pink-floyd-cover_fun\",\"site\":\"dailymotion.com\",\"date_found\":\"2015-06-30T00:00:00\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/s1.dmcdn.net\\/LiN0M.jpg\",\"id\":\"aa355c8e007744cf14895026d7205811\"},{\"title\":\"Pink Floyd - Coming Back To Life\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.dailymotion.com\\/video\\/x2vvb76_pink-floyd-coming-back-to-life_music\",\"site\":\"dailymotion.com\",\"date_found\":\"2015-06-30T00:00:00\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/s2.dmcdn.net\\/LsuEr.jpg\",\"id\":\"3cb3f5cfe7ed9752a299848b5cfab4e1\"},{\"title\":\"SCARECROW PINK FLOYD\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.dailymotion.com\\/video\\/x2uittz_scarecrow-pink-floyd_music\",\"site\":\"dailymotion.com\",\"date_found\":\"2015-06-30T00:00:00\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/s2.dmcdn.net\\/LYVz2.jpg\",\"id\":\"815a3a18540ef98c6b3675748cfaeadd\"},{\"title\":\"Pink Floyd - On The Turning Away (Live)\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.dailymotion.com\\/video\\/x2uxyyf_pink-floyd-on-the-turning-away-live_music\",\"site\":\"dailymotion.com\",\"date_found\":\"2015-06-30T00:00:00\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/s1.dmcdn.net\\/LetJ_.jpg\",\"id\":\"50c75c539efb47ad4216e66444790b45\"},{\"title\":\"P\\u00eenk Floyd - Paranoid eyes\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.dailymotion.com\\/video\\/x2vywtu_pink-floyd-paranoid-eyes_music\",\"site\":\"dailymotion.com\",\"date_found\":\"2015-06-30T00:00:00\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/s1.dmcdn.net\\/LuRHe.jpg\",\"id\":\"75b806ce51e28c155d42318eb582f543\"},{\"title\":\"Pink Floyd - The Happiest Days of Our Lives\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.dailymotion.com\\/video\\/x2usm3b_pink-floyd-the-happiest-days-of-our-lives_music\",\"site\":\"dailymotion.com\",\"date_found\":\"2015-06-30T00:00:00\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/s2.dmcdn.net\\/LcZ1S.jpg\",\"id\":\"8f5c260fa02760c2493f5ce2f49fabd5\"},{\"title\":\"Pink Floyd - Careful With That Axe, Eugene\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.dailymotion.com\\/video\\/x2vr0gu_pink-floyd-careful-with-that-axe-eugene_music\",\"site\":\"dailymotion.com\",\"date_found\":\"2015-06-30T00:00:00\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/s2.dmcdn.net\\/LqxRU.jpg\",\"id\":\"844b18513567fe0914582089764c2050\"},{\"title\":\"Pink Floyd - In The Flesh?\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.dailymotion.com\\/video\\/x2uzh1v_pink-floyd-in-the-flesh_music\",\"site\":\"dailymotion.com\",\"date_found\":\"2015-06-30T00:00:00\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/s2.dmcdn.net\\/LfQpr.jpg\",\"id\":\"5543be541f5bbd1c7fc0affb4a09fd4e\"},{\"title\":\"Pink Floyd - \\\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\\"\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.dailymotion.com\\/video\\/x2vvpps_pink-floyd-is-there-anybody-out-there_music\",\"site\":\"dailymotion.com\",\"date_found\":\"2015-06-30T00:00:00\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/s1.dmcdn.net\\/Ls4im.jpg\",\"id\":\"c0e9a35afb86203c839ea903d940aa5a\"},{\"title\":\"Pink Floyd - Have a Cigar feat.
