        "product_description"         => "When Irene Pepperberg, a professor at the University of Arizona, says goodnight, she typically hears the reply \"Bye. I'm gonna go eat dinner. I'll see you tomorrow.\" Though the response itself is not unusual, the source is, for it comes from Alex, a gray parrot, Pepperberg's main research subject for the past 22 years. That parrots can talk is well known; what Pepperberg set out to study was their cognitive abilities. By teaching the bird the meaning--not just the sound--of words in order to communicate, she hoped to discover how his brain worked. She exhaustively details her fascinating results in <I>The Alex Studies<\/I>.<p>  Pepperberg bought Alex--a parrot of average intelligence and without lofty pedigree or training--from a pet store when he was 1. Since working with Pepperberg, he has developed a 100-word vocabulary and can identify 50 different objects, recognizing quantities up to six, distinguishing seven colors and five shapes, and understanding the difference between big and small, same and different, over and under. He can tell you, for instance, that corn is yellow even if there is no corn in view, as well as correctly select the square object among various shapes and identify it verbally. What this all means, stresses Pepperberg, is that Alex is not merely parroting but actually thinking; he bases answers on reason rather than instinct or mimicry.<p>  Though the anecdotes are rich and Alex makes a lively subject, this is principally a research paper relying on intricate details and a prodigious amount of data (the notes and references alone run to 79 pages)<br><br>. This is not light reading, particularly for the layperson. Still, <I>The Alex Studies<\/I> manages to be more than a valuable contribution to science, for in providing ample evidence of our similarities to other creatures, the book ultimately calls into question the concept of human supremacy over the animal kingdom. Pepperberg's stated goal is \"to provoke awareness in humans that animals have capacities that are far greater than we were once led to expect, and to remind us that all we need to examine these capacities are some enlightened research tools.\" She has provided such tools in this seminal work. <I>--Shawn Carkonen<\/I>",

        "product_description"         => "In <em>Always On<\/em>, Naomi S. Baron reveals that online and mobile technologies--including instant messaging, cell phones, multitasking, Facebook, blogs, and wikis--are profoundly influencing how we read and write, speak and listen, but not in the ways we might suppose. Baron draws on a decade of research to provide an eye-opening look at language in an online and mobile world. She reveals for instance that email, IM, and text messaging have had surprisingly little impact on student writing. Electronic media has magnified the laid-back \"whatever\" attitude toward formal writing that young people everywhere have embraced, but it is not a cause of it. A more troubling trend, according to Baron, is the myriad ways in which we block incoming IMs, camouflage ourselves on Facebook, and use ring tones or caller ID to screen incoming calls on our mobile phones. Our ability to decide who to talk to, she argues, is likely to be among the most lasting influences that information technology has upon the ways we communicate with one another. Moreover, as more and more people are \"always on\" one technology or another--whether communicating, working, or just surfing the web or playing games--we have to ask what kind of people we are becoming, as individuals and as family members or friends, if the relationships we form must increasingly compete for our attention with digital media.",

The sensationalistic trial made headlines throughout the  world, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Yet opinion remained fiercely divided about Marks- -was she a spurned woman who had taken out her rage on two innocent victims, or was she an  unwilling victim herself, caught up in a crime she was too young to understand? Such doubts  persuaded the judges to commute her sentence to life imprisonment, and Marks spent the next 30  years in an assortment of jails and asylums, where she was often exhibited as a star attraction. In  Alias Grace, Margaret Atwood reconstructs Marks's story in fictional form. Her portraits  of 19th-century prison and asylum life are chilling in their detail. The author also introduces Dr  Simon Jordan, who listens to the prisoner's tale with a mixture of sympathy and disbelief. In his  effort to uncover the truth, Jordan uses the tools of the then rudimentary science of psychology.  But the last word belongs to the book's narrator--Grace herself.",

Bryan Talbot takes the city of Sunderland and the story of Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddell (the 'real' Alice) as the spine of his story and around them spins a spectacularly diverse range of different stories. He explores Carroll's links with Sunderland and shows how the city inspired his masterpieces. He delves into the city's history, from the Venerable Bede to George Formby, from its heyday as the greatest shipbuilding port in the world to its present multicultural mix. Talbot's artwork is a spectacular mixture of different styles: black and white ink line and pencil drawing, watercolour, collage and digitally manipulated photographic artwork. His stories are told from the stage of the Sunderland Empire theatre, an Edwardian music hall, and the book is a genuine variety performance. In \"Alice in Sunderland\", he shows - triumphantly - how local history is national history in microcosm, how one story begets another. The result is a landmark book in the graphic field.",

Inspired by school geography lessons that told of far-off lands, she broke out of the conventional options open to women in post-war Britain, defying her Merchant Navy father's dated views. She trained as a nurse and midwife, joined the Save the Children Fund, and was posted to Vietnam in 1967. One of only three British nurses in the region, Anne was faced with a vision of hell that her training at Manchester's Royal Infirmary had barely prepared her for. Thrown in at the deep end, she witnessed the random cruelty of warfare, nursing injured and orphaned children and caring for wounded and dying servicemen. She went on to take her skills to the victims of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, to Lebanon during the Israeli occupation, and Saudi Arabia during Desert Storm. Over some forty-five years Anne has brought her courage and compassion to those most in need of help. Woven into this vivid, compelling memoir is perhaps the most moving story of all - how Anne's idyllic childhood was shattered by a shocking family tragedy when she was 10 years old. A tragedy that was to shape her destiny.",

Indeed, the assumption that only wealthy women were involved in the militant campaign has led not only to the distortion of the WSPU membership, but it also neglects the significant contribution made by working-class women within it. Previously, few investigations have been carried out into local organisations of the Women's Social and Political Union, and as a consequence our understanding of local women within the party has been limited. Focusing on this central omission, this book, through the life and times of Alice Hawkins, seeks to redress the balance and add to our understanding of who the suffragettes were. But, more importantly, this book is about a woman who gave her life to the cause and, through her personality, shaped the lives of thousands of women.The importance of this book is that it is now slowly being recognised that history cannot shut away the lives and experiences of thousands of women like Alice Hawkins to concentrate on what was, to all intents and purposes, the public sphere. Her history, and those women like her, is an important omission, and without it the social composition of the movement will always remain unclear and the extent to which working women were involved will always remain hidden. Thus, the story of Alice Hawkins and the Leicester WSPU is, without doubt, crucial to our understanding of the organisation.",

Eddie's outlandish fantasies and metafictional tricks convert life into art, while staying fully grounded in his own absurdity. At every point, the author's uncanny eye for irony and wry self-awareness make even the smallest occasion into an opportunity for wit and wisdom. Quite simply, ALEC is a masterpiece of visual autobiography. <br><br>This Life-Size Omnibus edition of ALEC includes collects the previous Alec books The King Canute Crowd, Graffiti Kitchen, How to Be an Artist, Little Italy, The Dead Muse, The Dance of Lifey Death, and After the Snooter, as well as an all-new 35 page book, The Years Have Pants, and some other short stories rarely or never before seen.",

        "product_description"         => "<I>All's Well That Ends Well<\/I> has generally been considered one of Shakespeare's most difficult and unpopular plays. Labelled a \"Problem Comedy\", editors believe that the play was written between 1604 and 1605, and exhibits a darkening of Shakespeare's interest in comedy. The play deals with the complicated relationship between Helena, the daughter of a famous physician, and Bertram, the arrogant son of the Countess of Roussillon. Helena is secretly in love with Bertram, and when she miraculously cures the ailing King, she asks for Bertram's hand in marriage, to which the grateful sovereign happily agrees. Bertram bitterly opposes marriage to Helena, who he regards as a social inferior. After reluctantly agreeing to the marriage, Bertram flees to the wars in Italy with his companion Parolles. <p> What ensues is Helena's increasingly desperate and complex attempts to retrieve her errant husband, which involves various machinations and a piece of mistaken identity and an infamous \"bed-trick\" which has never fully convinced audiences or critics. More recently critics have been kinder to the play, seeing its cynical disillusionment with romance as reflecting contemporary social and political anxieties about warfare and commerce, and feminist critics have been keen to celebrate Helena as a particularly complex heroine. The play is also fascinated by language, encapsulated in the character of Parolles (or \"words\")<br><br>, and his memorable line for which the play is chiefly remembered: \"Simply the thing I am \/ Shall make me live\". --<I>Jerry Brotton<\/I>",

        "product_description"         => "In this cycle of 14 bittersweet stories, Walter Mosley breaks out of the  genre--if not the setting--of his bestselling Easy Rawlins detective novels. Only eight  years after serving out a prison sentence for murder, Socrates Fortlow lives in a tiny,  two-room Watts apartment, where he cooks on a hot plate, scavenges for bottles,  drinks and wrestles with his demons. Struggling to control a seemingly boundless  rage--as well as the power of his massive \"rock-breaking\" hands--Socrates must find a  way to live an honourable life as a black man on the margins of a white world, a task  which takes every ounce of self-control he has.   Easy Rawlins fans might initially find themselves disappointed by the absence of a  mystery to unravel. But it's a gripping inner drama that unfolds over the pages of  these stories, as Socrates comes to grips with the chaos, poverty and violence around  him. He tries to get and keep a job delivering groceries; takes in a young street kid  named Darryl, who has his own murder to hide; and helps drive out the  neighbourhood crack dealer. Throughout, Mosley captures the rhythms of Watts life  in prose both lyrical and hard-edged, resulting in a haunting look at a life bounded by  lust, violence, fear and a ruthlessly unsentimental moral vision.",

The sensationalistic trial made headlines throughout the  world, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Yet opinion remained fiercely divided about Marks- -was she a spurned woman who had taken out her rage on two innocent victims, or was she an  unwilling victim herself, caught up in a crime she was too young to understand? Such doubts  persuaded the judges to commute her sentence to life imprisonment, and Marks spent the next 30  years in an assortment of jails and asylums, where she was often exhibited as a star attraction. In  <I>Alias Grace<\/I>, Margaret Atwood reconstructs Marks's story in fictional form. Her portraits  of 19th-century prison and asylum life are chilling in their detail. The author also introduces Dr  Simon Jordan, who listens to the prisoner's tale with a mixture of sympathy and disbelief. In his  effort to uncover the truth, Jordan uses the tools of the then rudimentary science of psychology.  But the last word belongs to the book's narrator--Grace herself.",

And soon finds herself in an undead nightmare of rotting flesh and insanity. Venturing further into this land of zombies and monsters, she encounters characters both creepy and madcap along the way. But there's something else troubling poor Alice: her skin is rotting and her hair is falling out. She's cold.

This perennially popular Norton Critical Edition again reprints the 1897 editions of Alice&#x2019;s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass along with the 1876 edition of The Hunting of the Snark. Each text is fully annotated and the original illustrations are included. An unusually rich &#x201C;Backgrounds&#x201D; section is arranged to correspond with three clearly defined periods in Lewis Carroll&#x2019;s life. Letters and diary entries interwoven within each period emphasize the biographical dimension of Carroll&#x2019;s writing. Readers gain an understanding of the author&#x2019;s family and education, the evolution of the Alice books, and Carroll&#x2019;s later years through his own words and through important scholarly work on his faith life and his relationships with women and with Alice Hargreaves and her family. Reflecting the wealth of new scholarship on Alice in Wonderland and Lewis Carroll published since the last edition, Donald Gray has chosen eleven new critical works while retaining five seminal works from the previous edition. Two early pieces&#x2015;an essay by Charles Dickens and poem by Christina Rossetti&#x2015;take a satirical look at children&#x2019;s literature. The nine new recent essays are by James R. Kincaid, Marah Gubar, Robert M. Polemus, Jean-Jacques Lecercle, Gilles Deleuze, Roger Taylor, Carol Mavor, Jean Gatt&#x<br><br>E9;gno, and Helena M. Pycior. The Selected Bibliography has been updated and expanded.",

Particularly moving is her account of Alix and Nicky s final days in captivity... Rounding points out that the word passion means suffering as well as sexual excitement. It would be hard to think of any royal couple in history who embody this subtle double meaning more poignantly&#34; --Kathryn Hughes, Mail on Sunday",

Noted rail historian Brian Solomon looks back at the founding of Schenectady Locomotive Works in 1848 and proceeds to cover that company&rsquo;s merger with several smaller locomotive builders in 1901 to form Alco. Solomon describes the locomotives that made Alco&rsquo;s name around the world, from the standard designs like Mikados, Atlantics, and Mallets to the more powerful and flashy post&ndash;World War I models. His detailed, richly illustrated narrative re-creates the drama of a tough, ambitious company in the American tradition&mdash;rising again and again to the demands of an ever-changing industry and economy. &#160; Solomon also covers Alco electrics (built in partnership with GE)<br><br>, as well as the company&rsquo;s successful and quirky diesel offerings, including the RS-2 and RS-3 road switchers, FA\/FB road freight units, PA road passenger diesel, and the wares of Canadian affiliate Montreal Locomotive Works. Enlivened by numerous historical photographs, modern images, curious details, and firsthand accounts, this history is a complete, fascinating, and fitting tribute to a true icon of American railroading.",

All-age or family services often get a bad reputation and here Lucy Moore seeks to overcome this view and demonstrate, both the importance of all-age worship and how it can be done well in practice. This is the strength of the book: it's practical. The two most helpful chapters are on some basic rules of thumb (keep it simple, uses senses and emotions, use story, include participation, use invitation) and how to plan. Every chapter includes stories and examples. Creating space for the whole church to gather to worship for this reviewer is not an optional extra, but is integral to being church, and as Moore shows, this does not mean services which only cater for children. Reading this book will hopefully open up the possibility of how all-age worship might enrich a whole congregation and provide encouragement to those who either struggle with all-age or are looking for help. Reviewed by Andy Goodliff, Belle Vue Baptist Church, Southend on Sea From Ministry Matters - July 2010 I know that where all age worship has been successful in our church it has been the times when there has been a sense of us all being in it together making the service truly all age. It's a key question in your planning turning 'how do we include the children' into 'how can we do this together'. This sense of encountering God and learning together I believe is what should be at the heart of our all age times. I've recently read Lucy Moore's new book on all age worship and she makes this point. It's an excellent book that I would heartily recommend. Lucy also gives a useful list of key points that she calls 'touchstones' for all age worship, I found these tremendously helpful especially as none of them were exclusively for the benefit of children. Let me give you a sneak preview of four of them. They reflect some of the key aspects of good all age worship. *Short - Keep your services no longer than 40 minutes. *Symbol - Make use of symbolism especially around the Eucharist. *Space - Give the time and the means to reflect and respond in their own way. *Pattern - Follow a usual structure. All age worship is something I think we all find a challenge so please let me know what you do and how well it works and I'll try and pass it on through the Diocese. Reviewed by Sam Donohue From The Good Bookstall - June 2010 We call ourselves a Church family or the Body of Christ. Yet, in our worship we divide the family up rather than deal with the whole. Or we concentrate on doing things, going places for God, or watching for sin; without considering the monster it would be if it were only hands, or feet or eyes. Where is Jesus' command of open and accepting love? In her book All-Age Worship Lucy Moore sets worship in the context of community using the icon we call Rublev's Trinity - three people, interpreted as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, sitting in a circle, attending to one another, aware of one another, at one in their understanding and action. There is a space inviting us into this community, assuring us of love, understanding and acceptance. This suggests a Church glorying in intimate fellowship, but open and welcoming to outsiders, people who have a lot in common but who remain distinct from each other, a community which draws from the past but looks to the future. An all-age Church, she says, shows the richness and diversity of God, with worship and working together which allows members to develop and use their gifts. She challenges us to look at why we worship and points out that if we exclude any age group or people 'not like us' we are missing out on the richness God wants for us all. Churches should be places of healing on all levels and safe places where everyone can come close to God. Lucy gives us examples of different ways of learning, using word and story, drama, senses and emotions. She urges us to keep it simple and to be real in our love, faith and sharing. All age worship is difficult and challenging and much depends on the attitudes of leaders because it is not just what we do that matters but the way we do it. If all age worship is to be successful there will be change but she offers ways of coping with this, and advice on planning an all age act of worship. All-Age worship is about something much more profound than a form of worship which appeals to all ages. It is about what the Church is, and how we go about being the Church, the people of God. It is not a new and trendy idea but the rediscovery of an ancient skill. The icon shows us three different people at ease together, acting and loving as one, and that is the Church we aim to portray. A united Church knowing where it is going, open to and using the gifts and ideas of a wide range of people. Yes All-Age worship is difficult. Yes, it is scary. Yes, it involves a lot of work. But, if you are really interested and think this is way, then this book of Lucy Moore's is a must. She gives compelling reasons why the Church should worship together, is honest about the problems of achieving this and gives practical advice as to how to overcome these and achieve the vision of the family of God worshiping together in a way that allows everyone to come into God's presence and feel his love. Reviewed by Celia Rees From Christian Marketplace - Feburary 2010 Another new book which deserves a wide readership is All-Age Worship by Lucy Moore. If the title alone puts you off then that's more than enough reason for you to read it. This isn't just about that often dreaded time of the month 'when the children stay in', although there are plenty of ideas and suggestions for improving your 'intergenerational worship' efforts. Lucy Moore explores worship as a whole and gets the reader to think about why we do what we do in the way we do. As she says 'Our God is a God of exciting differences. Our worship can reflect his amazing multifaceted nature or it can be monochrome' (p57)<br><br>. She writes with humour and clarity and a good deal of common-sense.

Highly esteemed in Niger, the \"Alhazai\" proudly bear the title as a symbol of their economic success. This book traces the history of Maradi and the accession to power and prestige of the \"Alhazi\". When and how did they acquire their wealth?

How do they interact with other participants in the economy and society? Answers to these questions provide a glimpse of social change in the making, as traditional and modern influences merge.",

Then, to his amazement, Ben receives a summons to the White House \u2013 President Roosevelt, no less, has selected him personally to help look into lynchings performed by a newly emergent Ku Klux Klan.<p>As an insight into Alex Cross\u2019 background, this is both illuminating and provocative, but James Patterson (and his collaborator) prove quite as adroit at a historical narrative as at a contemporary one. --<I>Barry Forshaw<\/I>",

True Patterson fans will always welcome books such as <i>Cross<\/i> as the real deal: unadulterated James Patterson, sans collaborators.<p> Here we have Patterson's favourite protagonist, Alex Cross, in the days when he was making his mark in the Washington, DC Police Department. To his horror, he witnesses his wife being murdered in front of him by an unknown killer. Years pass, and Cross has left the FBI for his former profession as a psychologist. He feels he has come to terms with the events of the past, but then receives a call from his ex-partner John Sampson, requesting a favour in tracking down a serial rapist in Georgetown. Soon, the case presents connections to the death of Alex's wife -- is he finally being given the chance to catch her murderer? <p>This is James Patterson, doing what he does best: delivering a narrative in which there is not an ounce of wasted fat. Alex Cross is always, of course, a strong protagonist, and the personal element here energises an already kinetic storyline. James Patterson, we are reminded, needs no collaborators. --<I>Barry Forshaw<\/I>",

By the time of her premature death at the age of only thirty-five, Alice had lived through two wars, had lost two of her children, and had exhausted herself in her devotion to duty to the extent that she suffered from disillusionment almost to the point of despair. Nonetheless, in the final tragic weeks of her life, she met unimaginable grief with courage and serenity, and her last words demonstrated her ultimate redemption and the beautiful restoration of all she had loved and lost.",

Over the past 30 years, large farms have grown algae for food, feed and fuel for thousands of useful products. Now an era of microfarms is emerging. Algae microfarms can empower people to grow healthy food in their own community for food security and self-sufficiency.

Alec and Louie Harris were married for 46 years and 40 of those years, until Alec's passing in 1974, were devoted to bringing, as the Rev George May says, 'hope, comfort and enlightenment to countless people'.  Louie tells here of the development of trance, direct voice, healing and, after 6 years' work with their Spirit team, solid form materialisations in red light. Included are wonderful accounts of families reunited across the 'veil of death' and old friends conversing in many languages unknown to Alec.  Nine of the Spirit team are shown in the book, and in colour on the back cover, in drawings and paintings done by Alec Harris. His son, Bradley Harris has affirmed that his father's hand appeared to be controlled as he drew them and the pictures are as he, Bradley, remembers the Spirit Guides when they materialised.",

Hollowell's powerful narrative...is an excellent account of a humanitarian disaster....\" -- James Sater, author of Morocco: Challenges to Tradition and Modernity &#34;Hollowell deserves kudos.... There are many reasons to read Allah's Garden: It's a fast-paced and well-written adventure story with few equals, especially as it's true. The warmth of the regard between author and subject is a palpable presence, effusing the reading experience with a tenderness uncommon in such stories...bringing readers more global awareness.&#34; -- New Spirit Journal &#34;Allah's Garden...uses many strategies that make a war tale both gripping and bearable.

I loved it.' --Sarah Waters<br><br>An often funny, at times bittersweet novel, Always You, Edina tells the story of endlessly good-natured child narrator Bonnie as she negotiates family and school life in 1960's Britain. Most memorable is her crush on popular classmate Joanna Bayliss, who is alternately encouraging and dismissive, and Bonnie's love for the Edina of the title, her darling, glamorous aunt, whose relationship with other family members proves to be far from simple. Through Bonnie, VG Lee beautifully explores the inner life of a clever but naive pre-teen, and is particularly perceptive about the nature of burgeoning romantic love during childhood, and a child's growing understanding of the complexities of adult relationships. As you'd expect from Lee, this is a warm-hearted novel, and at the centre of its warm heart is Bonnie's relationship with her cantankerous raisin-eyed Gran, whom, in the present day, 50 year-old Bonnie visits in a residential home. There are revalations and surprises to come from these meetings, and one in particular had me cheering out loud for Bonnie.

While adults try to decipher  Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged  use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing \"The  dream-child moving through a land \/ Of wonders wild and new\". There they encounter the  White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle and the Mad Hatter, together with a  multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys  through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they  turn out to be \"curiouser and curiouser\", seemingly without moral or sense.   For more than 130 years, children have revelled in the delightfully non-moralistic,  non-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn Alice's new companions  scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the  \"regular course\" in school: Reeling, Writhing and branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,  Distraction, Uglification and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as  important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings,  reproduced here, are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

Labelled a \"Problem Comedy\", editors believe that the play was written between 1604 and 1605, and exhibits a darkening of Shakespeare's interest in comedy. The play deals with the complicated relationship between Helena, the daughter of a famous physician, and Bertram, the arrogant son of the Countess of Roussillon. Helena is secretly in love with Bertram, and when she miraculously cures the ailing King, she asks for Bertram's hand in marriage, to which the grateful sovereign happily agrees. Bertram bitterly opposes marriage to Helena, who he regards as a social inferior. After reluctantly agreeing to the marriage, Bertram flees to the wars in Italy with his companion Parolles. <p> What ensues is Helena's increasingly desperate and complex attempts to retrieve her errant husband, which involves various machinations and a piece of mistaken identity and an infamous \"bed-trick\" which has never fully convinced audiences or critics. More recently critics have been kinder to the play, seeing its cynical disillusionment with romance as reflecting contemporary social and political anxieties about warfare and commerce, and feminist critics have been keen to celebrate Helena as a particularly complex heroine.

They thus play a fundamental role in the world's ecosystems and a reliable and modern introduction to their kaleidoscopic diversity, systematics, and phylogeny is indispensable. In this textbook, the main groups of algae (divisions or phyla) are considered in turn. Each chapter begins with a summary of the principal characteristics of the group and interesting aspects of ecology and evolution. The final chapter is a synthesis, in which the phylogeny of the algae is discussed in relation to the evolution of other living organisms, primarily on the basis of evidence from recent molecular studies. This book is the completely revised and updated edition of a highly acclaimed German work, which was heralded for its clarity as well as its breadth and depth of information. This new edition takes into account recent reevaluations in algal systematics and phylogeny provided by the powerful techniques of molecular genetics and electron microscopy, as well as more traditional life history studies.    The book will be appropriate as an undergraduate text and as a reference for professionals in the field.",

Her mother died in a car accident a year ago.  Her father, a trucker determined to work through his grief, hasn't acknowledged Ali's burgeoning figure or complicated emotions.  Her friends still aren't sure how to talk about her mother's death.  And the Southern California forest that has always been Ali's refuge is about to be ravaged by logging.<br>Ali is about to discover that she is a princess-a fairy princess.  And that she has to save the world.  For real.  <br><br>To claim her fairy powers, Ali must overcome seven potentially lethal challenges.  Then she must scale a mountain and confront the King of the Dwarves and the King of the Elves, whose armies are poised to invade Earth.  <br><br>With her bemused 21st century friends, a sly leprechaun, and an extremely loyal, extremely ugly, troll by her side, Ali begins the most momentous journey of her young life, a journey during which she will learn much about herself and the past she thought she knew.  She will conquer fire and water, earth and air, and even time itself.  She will be both betrayer and betrayed, will see death close at hand, and will snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.  <br>Ali Warner is Alosha.  Welcome to her world.<br>",

His commitment to the communist cause, the pre-war anti-colonial struggle against Britain and, eventually, guerrilla warfare against the Japanese invaders, saw him propelled rapidly to senior positions within the CPM party structure. By the age of 18 he had become the key link between the communists' Malayan Peoples Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA) and Britain's clandestine Force 136, then endeavouring to set up intelligence-gathering operations behind enemy lines. Immediately following the Japanese surrender, Chin Peng was appointed to the Central Committee and, ultimately, his party's policy making Politburo. He was barely 21. At 23, he was formally named the CPM's Secretary General, it highest ranking figure. By June 1948, the Malayan Emergency erupted and Chin Peng, four months shy of his 24th year, became the British Empire's most wanted man.",

Then he sails to a desert island in Tunisia, visits Sicily and Corsica, and finally goes to Italy  and Malta before returning to Greece. While writing this book back in the U.S., Roth talked to hundreds of people and discovered that though most have heard about Odysseus and the Trojan horse, they have  never read The Iliad or The Odyssey",

A former Confederate soldier, Powell's role in the Lincoln conspiracy has been the subject of a great deal of debate. Was Powell simply a Southern sympathizer, who participated in an organized plot to kidnap Lincoln and exchange him for Confederate prisoners of war? Or was he recruited from Mosby's Rangers for special duty directed at the president and his cabinet? Through research on his life and military activities, these questions and others are answered.",

While adults try to decipher  Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged  use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing \"The  dream-child moving through a land \/ Of wonders wild and new\". There they encounter the  White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle and the Mad Hatter, together with a  multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys  through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they  turn out to be \"curiouser and curiouser\", seemingly without moral or sense.   For more than 130 years, children have revelled in the delightfully non-moralistic,  non-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn Alice's new companions  scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the  \"regular course\" in school: Reeling, Writhing and branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,  Distraction, Uglification and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as  important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings,  reproduced here, are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

Yet, no matter how deep the divisions or bitter the dispute, in the end, the allies always found ways to rise above their differences and preserve the integrity of an alliance which, by the late 1990s, had become the most successful in world history.           The diplomatic wrangling over the war in Iraq produced the worst transatlantic crisis in nearly fifty years, and for the first time leaders in both the United States and Europe are seriously questioning the viability and, indeed, even the value of the alliance. But is this latest crisis really so different from all those that came before it? Is it, as some contend, the culmination of an inevitable process of dissolution that began with the end of the Cold War and became clear after  9\/11? Is the fragile American-European alliance and the world order it supports coming unraveled?           In Allies at War distinguished Brookings analysts Philip Gordon and Jeremy Shapiro provides answer to these and other critical questions about the current crisis in American-European relations and its implications for the future.           To help put the current crisis into context the authors trace the evolution of American-European relations since World War II. They describe how deep ideological differences that emerged at the end of the Cold War and disputes over the Balkans,  Iran, and Iraq during the Clinton years already had some analysts questioning if the alliance would survive. They explain how the Bush administration's \"cowboy diplomacy\" helped bring already simmering tensions to a boil. And they provide a detailed, inside account of the events leading up to the Iraq crisis, describing how a series of disastrous diplomatic missteps turned a legitimate disagreement over how to deal with a rogue regime into a crisis that threatened the alliance's very existence.             Finally, in response to those who would say good riddance to an alliance that has given the West fifty years of unprecedented economic and political stability, the authors explain why continued US-European cooperation is essential to global security and prosperity. In an age of terrorism and globalization, they argue, no country or continent, no matter how strong, can stand alone.  Allies at War offers concrete prescriptions for mending the rifts that have opened in our relationship an",

A classic tale that has been interpreted by many an outstanding artist over the years, this remarkable story of one little girl who embarks on possibly one of the most amazing, fantastical adventures in literary history has more than stood the test of time. Here, in this stunning new edition, Helen Oxenbury, one of the most exceptional contemporary children's illustrators, turns her hand to what is certainly no small project and has succeeded in surpassing expectation. More abundantly illustrated than other editions of the same work, this unabridged version is packed with contemporary and accessible interpretations of the kaleidoscope of characters--the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, the Queen of Hearts--who have each captured the imaginations of generations of children.Alice herself is portrayed as a thoroughly modern miss--casually dressed, personable, and spirited--and her surroundings are brought to effervescent life with a warmth, depth and distinctive sense of humour that perfectly complements the shenanigans of the topsy-turvy world of Wonderland. A perfect gift for any child, this stylish, must-have version of Carroll's unforgettable fantasy is perfect for confident young readers to read alone, or is ideal for sharing as a bedtime read with an adult.

Marshall traveled this spectacular country, from the Upper Koyukuk drainage to the Arctic Divide, making maps, recording scientific data, and exalting in the beauty of that incredibly pristine landscape. Although his early death at thirty-eight ended an exceptional life too early, he left journals and letters to describe his favorite place on earth. These were edited by his brother George Marshall and were compiled to create this classic of environmental literature, now in its third edition after nearly fifty years in print and with a new foreword by Rick Bass.",

Today, the long-standing and impassioned debate about the so-called authorship question is perceived by Shakespearean scholars as the preserve of eccentrics and cranks. But in this contrarian work of literary detection, author Joseph Sobran boldly reopens this debate and allows the members of Shakespeare's vast contemporary public to weigh all the evidence and decide for themselves. An enormous shelf of biographical scholarship has grown up over the past 300 years around the \"Swan of Avon.\" But what are these histories based on? Revealing that no more than a handful of fragmentary documents attest to Shakespeare's existence - and virtually none which link him to the plays themselves - Sobran delightfully debunks this elaborate egalitarian myth concocted in equal parts of speculation, wishfulness, and fantasy. More importantly, Sobran shows how many questions the myth leaves unanswered: How could a provincial actor from Stratford gain such an intimate knowledge of court life? How could he know so much of classical authors and not own a single book? How could he write compromising love sonnets to his social superior, the powerful Earl of Southampton? How could he know so much of Italy, a place he never visited? Why was there no notice of the famous writer's death in 1616? Why, in short, does Shakespeare remain such an obscure and shadowy figure? Methodically demolishing the case for \"Mr. Shakspere, \" Sobran shows it is highly implausible that he wrote the poems and plays we know as The Works of William Shakespeare. Other candidates exist, of course, including Ben Jonson, Christopher Marlowe, and Francis Bacon. Sobran dispenses with these claimants, then setsforth the startlingly persuasive case for Edward de Vere, the seventeenth Earl of Oxford. Oxford was a widely traveled, classically educated member of the Elizabethan court. A swashbuckling spendthrift, he swung high and low in the eyes of his peers. Having spent most of his fort",

More than a simple story about a girl losing her father to a war she can't stop, it's a story of hope & love and growing up overnight. A story that will have you thrilled at the possibility of young love and have your eyes opened wide to the tragedy that comes with wartime. It's possible that I could write for hours about this brilliant novel that is definitely in my Top Ten books ever read, but I won't. I'll simply say, go read this novel it will change you forever!' --chicklitreviews.com'If it sounds like a bit of an emotional heavyweight, it should. Stand by for tear-jerking flashbacks and, at one point, some distant echoes of Cecelia Ahern's PS I Love You. Harrington's playwright roots and heavy use of dialogue making the characters authentic. The emotionally taut conversations between Alice and her mother are particularly well executed.' --Stylist Book of the Week'This moving debut novel, from playwright Laura Harrington, explores the emotions children experience when a parent goes to war.' --**** Star Magazine`Alice is 15 and not afraid to stand up for the things she believes in. But when her beloved father is sent away to war, she finds she has to grow up quickly in an emotional novel from this debut author.'  --Bella magazine`Alice's dad goes to war and then the unthinkable happens. This story of friendship, love, grief and growing up will yank on the heartstrings. And then some.' --Look magazine`Seen mainly through the eyes of 14 year old Alice - whose relationship with her father is tenderly and movingly realised - she struggles to come to terms with this unlooked-for coming of age . . . The setting and writing style is American through and through, but the relationships at its heart are recognisable anywhere.' --Sunday Times<br><br>      --This text refers to the <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Paperback<br><br> edition.",

Alex Cross&rsquo;s Trial, the latest outing, is something very different for his quadriplegic investigator, but Patterson (as ever) displays the page-turning skills that are his trademark (assuming, of course, that the bulk of the book is his work &ndash; this is another of his many portmanteau efforts; from his army of co-authors, he here utilises Richard Dilallo)<br><br>.The innovations in Alex Cross&rsquo;s Trial involve nothing less than Alex himself narrating the story of young Washington lawyer Ben Corbett who lived at the turn of the Nineteenth Century.Ben is highly adept at his job, but is still regarded by his wife and father as something of a failure, wasting his time (as they see it) by doing unremunerative work for the poor and oppressed. Then, to his amazement, Ben receives a summons to the White House &ndash; President Roosevelt, no less, has selected him personally to help look into lynchings performed by a newly emergent Ku Klux Klan.As an insight into Alex Cross&rsquo; background, this is both illuminating and provocative, but James Patterson (and his collaborator) prove quite as adroit at a historical narrative as at a contemporary one. --Barry Forshaw",

This is what Thomas Mc<br><br>Namee does most handily in his <i>Alice Waters and Chez Panisse<\/i>, a chronicle that begins with the seat-of-the-pants opening night of the \"counterculture\" venture in 1971, and ends 35 years later with Waters's restaurant an American institution--one credited with birthing California Cuisine, a style devoted to simplicity, freshness and seasonality. The book also limns, with tasty gossip, the ever-evolving Chez Panisse family, including the cook-artisans uniquely responsible for dish creation; follows the attempts, mostly failed, to put the restaurant on sound financial footing; shows how dishes and menus get made; and of course pursues Waters as she broadens her commitment to \"virtuous agriculture\" by establishing ventures like The Edible Schoolyard and The Yale Sustainable Food Project.  <p> The success of Chez Panisse--<i>Gourmet<\/i> magazine named it the best American restaurant in 2002--has everything to do with Waters, yet she remains an elusive protagonist.  Sophisticated yet naive, professional and amateur, hard-driving but emotionally blurry, she invites reader interest but doesn't always satisfy it, as least as presented here. If Mc<br><br>Namee cannot quite bring her to life, and if his tale lacks an insider's full conversance with his subject, he still engages readers in the considerable drama of people finding their way--blunderingly, with talented intent--to something new. With menus, narrated recipes, and photographs throughout, the book is vital reading for anyone interested in food, period.  <i>--Arthur Boehm<\/i>",

I'll see you tomorrow.\" Though the response itself is not unusual, the source is, for it comes from Alex, a gray parrot, Pepperberg's main research subject for the past 22 years. That parrots can talk is well known; what Pepperberg set out to study was their cognitive abilities. By teaching the bird the meaning--not just the sound--of words in order to communicate, she hoped to discover how his brain worked. She exhaustively details her fascinating results in <I>The Alex Studies<\/I>.<p>  Pepperberg bought Alex--a parrot of average intelligence and without lofty pedigree or training--from a pet store when he was 1. Since working with Pepperberg, he has developed a 100-word vocabulary and can identify 50 different objects, recognizing quantities up to six, distinguishing seven colors and five shapes, and understanding the difference between big and small, same and different, over and under. He can tell you, for instance, that corn is yellow even if there is no corn in view, as well as correctly select the square object among various shapes and identify it verbally. What this all means, stresses Pepperberg, is that Alex is not merely parroting but actually thinking; he bases answers on reason rather than instinct or mimicry.<p>  Though the anecdotes are rich and Alex makes a lively subject, this is principally a research paper relying on intricate details and a prodigious amount of data (the notes and references alone run to 79 pages)<br><br>. This is not light reading, particularly for the layperson. Still, <I>The Alex Studies<\/I> manages to be more than a valuable contribution to science, for in providing ample evidence of our similarities to other creatures, the book ultimately calls into question the concept of human supremacy over the animal kingdom. Pepperberg's stated goal is \"to provoke awareness in humans that animals have capacities that are far greater than we were once led to expect, and to remind us that all we need to examine these capacities are some enlightened research tools.\" She has provided such tools in this seminal work. <I>--Shawn Carkonen<\/I>",

Further chapters deal with racing and the Ise of Man., The War Years, Experimental and Limited Production Models, Specials, Trials and Six Day Events and Records and Record breaking.  The penultimate chapter mentions many of the colourful personalities who were engages in one way or another with the production of the Velocette.

There are 163 photographs and drawings, come almost as interesting for the fashions displayed as for the machinery.   There are appendices covering notes on part numbers, the original MII KSS Instruction Book, Wiring Diagrams, Specifications of the 1939 models, the Velocette Owners Club and the LE Velo Club.

She came very close to her goal of overthrowing the government but was defeated and fled to Kenya.<p>This book provides a unique view of Alice's movement, based on interviews with its members and including their own writings, examining their perceptions of the threat of external and internal evil. It concludes with an account of the successor movements into which Alice's forces fragmented and which are still active in the civil wars of the Sudan and Uganda.",

Overshadowed by the more powerful European clergy, the experiences of these native assistants--the duties they performed, the historical mechanisms by which they learned Spanish law and writing, their juridical altercations with royal and church authority, and the consequences of native litigation for evangelization as a whole--provide a unique vantage point from which to observe the everyday workings of Spanish colonialism.<\/p><p>Focusing on the highland parishes of the Lima archdiocese, John Charles explores the vital, often conflictive role indigenous agents played in the creation of Andean Christian society. Torn between their obligation to enforce colonial laws and their customary obligation to protect native communities from the colonizers' abuses, <i>indios ladinos<\/i> used the Spanish language to complicate the Church's efforts to evangelize on its own terms. Utilizing a vast body of literary activity, Allies at Odds provides perspective on the Spanish cultural values that shaped the literary activity of native Andeans and that native Andeans had a part in shaping.<\/p>",

Labelled a \"Problem Comedy\", editors believe that the play was written between 1604 and 1605, and exhibits a darkening of Shakespeare's interest in comedy. The play deals with the complicated relationship between Helena, the daughter of a famous physician, and Bertram, the arrogant son of the Countess of Roussillon. Helena is secretly in love with Bertram, and when she miraculously cures the ailing King, she asks for Bertram's hand in marriage, to which the grateful sovereign happily agrees. Bertram bitterly opposes marriage to Helena, who he regards as a social inferior. After reluctantly agreeing to the marriage, Bertram flees to the wars in Italy with his companion Parolles.  What ensues is Helena's increasingly desperate and complex attempts to retrieve her errant husband, which involves various machinations and a piece of mistaken identity and an infamous \"bed-trick\" which has never fully convinced audiences or critics. More recently critics have been kinder to the play, seeing its cynical disillusionment with romance as reflecting contemporary social and political anxieties about warfare and commerce, and feminist critics have been keen to celebrate Helena as a particularly complex heroine. The play is also fascinated by language, encapsulated in the character of Parolles (or \"words\")<br><br>, and his memorable line for which the play is chiefly remembered: \"Simply the thing I am \/ Shall make me live\". --Jerry Brotton",

Risking her very life for the opportunity to choose Bertram as her husband, Helena's bid for Bertram's hand turns out to be only the beginning of a series of trials and tribulations. Finally, at the end of a comic maze of mistaken identities, betrayals, repentance, and dramatic revelations, Helena's efforts to corral her unwilling lover achieve joyful fulfillment.<br>An ambiguous work in which mirthful entertainment is interwoven with a powerful subtext condemning class prejudice, this play possesses a singular combination of amusement and profundity that has intrigued scholars and theatergoers for four centuries.",

A police procedural, a thriller against time, a race between hunted and hunter, and a whydunnit, written from multiple points of view that explore several apparently parallel stories which finally meet.\"<br><br> Alex Prevost--kidnapped, savagely beaten, suspended from the ceiling of an abandoned warehouse in a tiny wooden cage--is running out of time. Her abductor appears to want only to watch her die. Will hunger, thirst, or the rats get her first?<br><br> Apart from a shaky eyewitness report of the abduction, Police Commandant Camille Verhoeven has nothing to go on: no suspect, no leads, and no family or friends anxious to find a missing loved one. The diminutive and brilliant detective knows from bitter experience the urgency of finding the missing woman as quickly as possible--but first he must understand more about her. <br><br> As he uncovers the details of the young woman's singular history, Camille is forced to acknowledge that the person he seeks is no ordinary victim. She is beautiful, yes, but also extremely tough and resourceful.

But when she tanks the SATs, her automatic assumptions about going to college don't appear to be so automatic anymore. She determines that her only hope for college admission is to win the election for student body president. Unfortunately, with her razor wit and acid tongue she's bettersuited to dishing out insults than winning votes.<br><br>When she brashly bets her classmate Logan that she can go two weeks without uttering a single insult, Samantha immediately realizes that she may have bitten off more than she can chew. And when her current boyfriend dumps her, less than three weeks before the prom, it couldn't be a worse time to be forced to keep her opinions to herself. Finding a new boyfriend will be a challenge now that Logan shadows her every move, hoping to catch her slipping back into her old ways. Samantha is determined to win the election and find a dream date for the prom, no matter what it takes. After all . . . all's fair in love and war (and high school!)<br><br>.<br>",

God's promises become <I>exceedingly great and precious<\/I> to us when  nothing else will do. By way of digging into the theology of God's Promises, Pastor  James uncovers 5 major categories of promise in the Bible and the 5 areas about  which God repeatedly makes promises. From what to do with fear and doubt to God's  goodness, help, and victory-the Bible has much to say about God's presence in our  difficulty.<\/P><P>Last year, Pastor James released <I>When Life is Hard<\/I> to  point you toward hope in the midst of trials. Now,\u00a0<I>Always True<\/I>\u00a0will  point you to God's promises, which are <I>always<\/I> true.<BR><\/P>",

        "product_description"         => "What did America lose with the decline of the passenger train?  Much more than most Americans think. The greatest loss is the alliance  between technology and the land, according to public historian Alfred  Runte. Once abandoning railroads would have been unthinkable, but we have  virtually forgotten the importance of trains for our country and for  ourselves. Now the landscape suffers in our mindless rush to get rid of old  technology and blindly embrace the new.  <P>Runte asks us to reevaluate existing modes of transportation and to  recognize the need for railroads--not just as a safe, efficient, and  interactive means of travel, but also as effective stewards for our  dwindling landscape. Challenging the notion that speed is the only way to  conquer our nation's expanse or that beauty does not matter, Runte reminds  us of our love for distance, and the joys of open space. Travel is not only  about arriving at our destination quickly, but is also what we experience  along our route. Recalling train travel experiences of his own, Runte  invites us to interact as we travel, to look out the train window at our  country, and to care passionately about the landscape we see. <P>Noting our own history as well as Europe's, Runte points out what has gone  wrong with the U.S. railroad system and calls us all to task: railroad  companies, Amtrak, the U.S. government, environmentalists, economists,  politicians, railroad historians, and ordinary citizens. As a true  visionary with a deep respect for the land and its people, Runte asks us to  open our eyes and our minds to the idea that beauty could once again be  part of our daily lives. He gives us hope that railroads we so carelessly  threw away may still be restored to preserve the remaining glories of our  continent.<BR><BR>------- <P>Although few Americans use passenger trains today, we still love railroads.  We say we want to preserve our national parks, countryside, and urban  landscapes, yet we keep tearing into the best of them every day. Once  abandoning railroads would have been unthinkable, but we have forgotten the  importance of trains for our earth and for ourselves. Alfred Runte  challenges our notion that adding highways and airports will help us reach  our destinations more quickly, or meet our transportation and environmental  goals. He dares us to care about what we see as we travel and to believe  railroads hold a key to preserving our national landscapes. As a true  visionary with a deep respect for the land and its people, Runte gives us  hope that by restoring our trains, we can save our nation's imperiled  natural beauty.",

It is a call to action for faculty, staff, and administrators in all facets of higher education, and emphasizes the shared responsibility toward students with disabilities and toward creating meaningful change.<\/p> <p>This monograph begins with a look into the future of disability education. How will students create their own identities? Will there be a need for disability accommodations or will a universally designed world eliminate that current necessity? It also looks at the past, with discussions of disability legislation such as the ADA of 1990, the impact of Supreme Court decisions, descriptions of college students with disabilities, and the paradigm shift from the medical \u201cdeficit\u201d model of disability to one that focuses on the individual\u2019s lived experience as a social construct.<\/p> <p>Drawing on theoretical frameworks in multiple disciplines, disability identity development is explained, ally development is defined, and disability services are explored. The monograph ends with a discussion of where disability education is now and how faculty, staff, and administrators will continue to be allies of inclusion for students in the years to come.<\/p> <p>This is the 5th issue of the 39th volume of the Jossey-Bass series ASHE Higher Education Report. Each monograph is the definitive analysis of a tough higher education issue, based on thorough research of pertinent literature and institutional experiences.

        "product_description"         => "A tale of two journeys...On May 13, 1939, the luxury liner SS St. Louis sailed away from Hamburg, Germany, bound for Havana, Cuba. On board were more than 900 Jewish refugees fleeing persecution in Nazi Germany. But an indifferent world conspired against them. After being denied landing rights in Havana, the refugees were turned away by the United States and Canada and forced to sail back to Europe, where the gathering storm of the Holocaust awaited them.Two of those refugees were Alex Goldschmidt, a sixty-year-old veteran of World War I, and his seventeen-year-old son Klaus Helmut Goldschmidt. After their trans-Atlantic voyage, they landed in France. They would spend the next three years in one French camp after another before being shipped to Auschwitz in 1942.Sixty-nine years later, Martin Goldsmith, Alex's grandson and Helmut's nephew, retraced their sad journey. Beginning in lower Saxony where Alex was born, Martin spent six weeks on the road and covered more than 5,700 miles, setting foot on the earth Alex and Helmut trod during their final days. Alex's Wake is Martin's eyewitness report.The book offers a compelling history of the voyage of the St. Louis, including testimony from those on board, a tale of espionage, and the brave resolve of Captain Gustav Schroeder. It also offers a harrowing chronicle of the vast network of camps in France, many of which were organized by the French themselves with little or no encouragement from the Germans.But Alex's Wake is also a contemporary travelogue and a heartfelt memoir of a second-generation American Jew trying to make sense of his heritage and to escape the burden of guilt and fear he long thought was his sole inheritance. Setting forth with the irrational, impossible desire to save two members of his family who were murdered ten years before he was born, Goldsmith concludes his journey by coming home to a moving symbol of remembrance at one of the scenes of the crime.",

While family members have always provided care for one another, recent changes in health care have placed tremendous new responsibilities on them--responsibilities that, only a decade ago, were a routine part of hospital care. The prevalence of chronic rather than acute illness, trends toward shorter hospital stays, increased outpatient care, and limited insurance benefits for in-home care now leave family caregiving as the only option for many Americans.<\/p><P>This book, first published in 2000 and now substantially updated, presents an intimate look at the world of family caregiving. The compelling narratives by caregivers capture the intensity of the caregiving experience, while chapters by noted health care professionals, many of whom speak of their own experiences, analyze the impact of caregiving, urge more professional advocacy on behalf of caregivers, and offer insightful suggestions for building partnerships for change and fostering improvement. This second edition includes:<BR>- caregiving as a workplace dilemma<BR>- the added burdens of end-of-life caregiving<BR>- clinician-family conflicts (and new approaches for resolving them) <BR>- new federal and state policy initiatives<BR>- resources for families and professionals<BR>- a new section on innovative caregiving programs<BR>- new chapter on the financial impact of caregiving<\/p><P>Designed for family caregivers, health professionals, administrators, pastoral care providers, policymakers, patient and caregiver advocates, and human resource professionals, <I>Always on Call<\/i>  is an essential book for understanding the current realities of family caregiving.

Simply put, we have greater access to highly stimulating sexual content, and potential sexual partners, with much less built-in accountability. Porn addicts are especially vulnerable to the lure of digital technology and the seemingly endless array of stimulation it provides. Research suggests that cyber-porn addicts spend at least eleven or twelve hours per week online viewing porn.<\/p><p>Today, all forms of sex addiction are technology driven\u2014from porn websites to webcams to casual sex hook-up apps found on smartphones. Sex addicts organize their lives around the pursuit of sexual activity with self or others, spending inordinate amounts of time viewing and masturbating to porn or planning, pursuing, and engaging in sex acts. At the same time, they neglect important relationships, work, and personal responsibilities. Overwhelming feelings of guilt, shame, and remorse invade when the acting out ends.<\/p><p>While it's complicated, recovery is possible. <I>Always Turned On<\/I> shows readers how to turn those temptations off while providing practical long-term solutions for recovery.<\/p><p><B>Robert Weiss, MSW<\/B>, is a therapist, international speaker, and regular blogger on Psych Central and the <I>Huffington Post<\/I>.<\/p><p><B>Jennifer P.

She was born deaf, at Windsor Castle, in the presence of her grandmother, Queen Victoria, and brought up in England, Darmstadt, and Malta.<br><br>In 1903 she married Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, and from then on her life was overshadowed by wars, revolutions, and enforced periods of exile.  By the time she was thirty-five, virtually every point of stability was overthrown.  Though the British royal family remained in the ascendant, her German family ceased to be ruling princes, her two aunts who had married Russian royalty had come to savage ends, and soon afterwards Alice's own husband was nearly executed as a political scapegoat.<br><br>The middle years of her life, which should have followed a conventional and fulfilling path, did the opposite.  She suffered from a serious religious crisis and at the age of forty-five was removed from her family and placed in a sanitarium in Switzerland, where she was pronounced a paranoid schizophrenic.  As her stay in the clinic became prolonged, there was a time where it seemed she might never walk free again.  How she achieved her recovery is just one of the remarkable aspects of her story.",

During the war their functions came to encompass a host of foreign policy concerns, however, and so powerful did the military voice become on those issues that only the president exercised a more decisive role in their outcome.Drawing on sources that include the unpublished records of the Joint Chiefs as well as the War, Navy, and State Departments, Mark Stoler analyzes the wartime rise of military influence in U.S. foreign policy. He focuses on the evolution of and debates over U.S. and Allied global strategy. In the process, he examines military fears regarding America's major allies--Great Britain and the Soviet Union--and how those fears affected President Franklin D. Roosevelt's policies, interservice and civil-military relations, military-academic relations, and postwar national security policy as well as wartime strategy.",

        "product_description"         => "In recent years, the claims of genetics and evolutionary psychology to explain and indeed legislate on the human condition have been loudly trumpeted in a host of popular books. Genes are said to account for almost every aspect of our lives. Evolution is supposed to explain alleged human universals, from male philandering and female coyness to children's dislike of spinach. There are even claimed to be genes that account for differences between people -- from sexual orientation to drug addiction, aggression, religiosity, and job satisfaction. It appears that Darwin, at least in the hands of his popularizers, has replaced Marx and Freud as the great interpreter of human existence.<br><br>Biologists, social scientists, and philosophers have begun to rebel against this undisciplined approach to their different understandings of the world, demonstrating that the claims of evolutionary psychology rest on shaky empirical evidence, flawed premises, and unexamined political presuppositions. In this groundbreaking book, Hilary Rose and Steven Rose have gathered the leading and outspoken critics of this fashionable ideology in a shared and uniquely cross-disciplinary project. Contributors range from biologists Stephen Jay Gould, Gabriel Dover, Patrick Bateson, and Anne Fausto-Sterling; to anthropologists and sociologists Dorothy Nelkin, Tim Ingold, Tom Shakespeare, and Ted Benton; to philosopher Mary Midgley and cultural critics Barbara Herrnstein Smith and Charles Jencks.<br><br>The result of this joint work, <b>Alas Poor Darwin<\/b>, is a sharply engaged, accessible, and highly entertaining critique of evolutionary psychology's tenets. What emerges is a new perspective that challenges the reductionism of evolutionary psychology and offers a richer understanding of the biosocial nature of the human condition.",

In vivid detail, Agos\u00edn contrasts the beauty of the Chilean countryside with the ugliness of the entrenched anti-Semitism that made her father a permanent outsider. . . . Agos\u00edn paints a moving portrait of a man who, despite his love for his family, his work, and classical music, was, like herself, marked at the core of his identity as a wandering exile.\"\u2014<I>Publishers Weekly<\/I><BR> \"This is a haunting work of extraordinary grace and depth.\"\u2014Claribel Alegria<BR><B>Marjorie Agos\u00edn<\/B> is author of many volumes of poetry, fiction, and essays.

Yet belief in other worldly phenomena, from poltergeists to telepathy, remains strong, as Gillian Bennett's research shows. Especially common is belief in continuing contact with, or the continuing presence of, dead family members. Bennett interviewed women in Manchester, England, asking them questions about ghosts and other aspects of the supernatural. (Her discussion of how her research methods and interview techniques evolved is in itself valuable.) She first published the results of the study in the well-received Traditions of Belief: Women and the Supernatural, which has been widely used in folklore and women's studies courses. \"Alas, Poor Ghost!\" extensively revises and expands that work. In addition to a fuller presentation and analysis of the original field research and other added material, the author, assisted by Kate Bennett, a gerontological psychologist, presents and discusses new research with a group of women in Leicester, England.  Bennett is interested in more than measuring the extent of belief in other worldly manifestations. Her work explores the relationship between narrative and belief. She anticipated that her questions would elicit from her interviewees not just yes or no replies but stories about their experiences that confirmed or denied notions of the supernatural. The more controversial the subject matter, the more likely individuals were to tell stories, especially if their answers to questions of belief were positive. These were most commonly individualized narratives of personal experience, but they contained many of the traditional motifs and other content, including belief in the supernatural, of legends. Bennett calls them memorates and discusses the cultural processes, including ideas of what is a \"proper\" experience of the supernatural and a \"proper\" telling of the story, that make them communal as well as individual. These memorates provide direct and vivid examples of what the storytellers actually believe and disbelieve. In a final section, Bennett places her work in historical context through a discussion of case studies in the history of supernatural belief.",

It describes how the deep strategic differences that emerged at the end of the Cold War and the disputes over the Balkans and the Middle East during the Clinton years already had some analysts questioning whether the Alliance could survive. It shows how the Bush administration\u2019s unilateral diplomacy and world-view helped bring already simmering tensions to a boil, and describes in depth the events leading up to the Iraq crisis of 2003.<\/p> <p>Gordon and Shapiro explain how powerful forces such rising American power and the September 11 terrorist attacks have made relations between America and Europe increasingly difficult. But the authors argue that the split over Iraq was not inevitable: it was the result of misguided decisions and unnecessary provocations on both sides. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that claims that the Iraq war signaled the effective end of the Atlantic Alliance, the authors warn that assuming the end of the Alliance could quickly become a self-fulfilling prophesy: leaving the United States isolated, resented, and responsible for bearing the burdens of maintaining international security largely alone.<\/p> <p>In response to those who argue that the Atlantic Alliance is no longer viable or necessary, ALLIES AT WAR demonstrates that even after Iraq, the United States and Europe can work together, and indeed must if they wish to effectively address the most pressing problems of our age. The book makes concrete proposals for restoring transatlantic relations and updating the alliance to meet new challenges like global terrorism and the transformation of an unstable Middle East.<\/p>",

Most dramatically, children today have a shorter life expectancy than their parents, something never before\u00a0seen in the course of human history. They will face more chronic illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes that will further burden our healthcare system. Here, authors Jacob Warren and K. Bryant Smalley examine the full effects of childhood obesity and offer the provocative message that being overweight in youth is not a disease but the result of poor lifestyle choices. Theirs is a clarion call for parents to have \"the talk\" with their kids, which medical professionals say is a harder topic\u00a0to address\u00a0than sex or drugs.

Only eight years after serving out a prison sentence for  murder, Socrates Fortlow lives in a tiny, two-room Watts apartment, where he cooks on a hot plate,  scavenges for bottles, drinks, and wrestles with his demons. Struggling to control a seemingly boundless  rage--as well as the power of his massive \"rock-breaking\" hands--Socrates must find a way to  live an honorable life as a black man on the margins of a white world, a  task which takes every ounce of  self-control he has. <P> Easy Rawlins fans might initially find themselves disappointed by the absence of a mystery to unravel. But  it's a gripping inner drama that unfolds over the pages of these stories, as Socrates comes to grips with the  chaos, poverty, and violence around him. He tries to get and keep a job delivering groceries; takes in a  young street kid named Darryl, who has his own murder to hide; and helps drive out the neighborhood  crack dealer. Throughout, Mosley captures the rhythms of Watts life in prose both musical and hard-edged,  resulting in a haunting look at a life bounded by lust, violence, fear, and a ruthlessly unsentimental moral  vision.",

But they won the 19th Amendment, ensuring that the right to vote cannot be denied because of gender. Their successful nonviolent civil rights campaign established a precedent for those that followed, giving them the tools--including the vote--needed to advance their goals.

        "product_description"         => "Alaska is home to more than two hundred federally recognized tribes. Yet the long histories and diverse cultures of Alaska&rsquo;s first peoples are often ignored, while the stories of Russian fur hunters and American gold miners, of salmon canneries and oil pipelines, are praised. Filled with essays, poems, songs, stories, maps, and visual art, this volume foregrounds the perspectives of Alaska Native people, from a Tlingit photographer to Athabascan and Yup&rsquo;ik linguists, and from an Alutiiq mask carver to a prominent Native politician and member of Alaska&rsquo;s House of Representatives. The contributors, most of whom are Alaska Natives, include scholars, political leaders, activists, and artists. The majority of the pieces in The Alaska Native Reader were written especially for the volume, while several were translated from Native languages.The Alaska Native Reader describes indigenous worldviews, languages, arts, and other cultural traditions as well as contemporary efforts to preserve them. Several pieces examine Alaska Natives&rsquo; experiences of and resistance to Russian and American colonialism; some of these address land claims, self-determination, and sovereignty. Some essays discuss contemporary Alaska Native literature, indigenous philosophical and spiritual tenets, and the ways that Native peoples are represented in the media. Others take up such diverse topics as the use of digital technologies to document Native cultures, planning systems that have enabled indigenous communities to survive in the Arctic for thousands of years, and a project to accurately represent Dena&rsquo;ina heritage in and around Anchorage. Fourteen of the volume&rsquo;s many illustrations appear in color, including work by the contemporary artists Subhankar Banerjee, Perry Eaton, Erica Lord, and Larry Mc<br><br>Neil.",

Raised by Quaker parents in Moorestown, New Jersey, she would become a passionate and outspoken leader of the woman suffrage movement. In 1913, she reinvigorated the American campaign for a constitutional suffrage amendment and, in the next seven years, dominated that campaign and drove it to victory with bold, controversial action -wedding courage with resourcefulness and self-mastery. <br><br>This biography of Paul's early years and suffrage leadership offers fresh insight into her private persona and public image, examining for the first time the sources of Paul's ambition and the growth of her political consciousness. Using extensive oral history interviews with Paul and her colleagues, Authors J. D. Zahniser and Amelia R. Fry substantially revise our understanding about Paul's engagement with suffrage activism in England and later emergence onto the American scene. Though her Quaker upbringing has long been seen as the spark for her commitment to women's rights Zahniser and Fry show how her childhood among the Friends forged crucial aspects of Paul's character, but her political zeal developed out of years of education and exploration. The authors explore the ways in which her involvement with the British suffragists Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst honed her instincts and skills, especially her dealings with her most important political adversaries, Woodrow Wilson and rival suffrage leader Carrie Chapman Catt.  Applying new research to the persistent questions about Alice Paul and her legacy this compelling biography analyzes Paul's charisma and leadership qualities, sheds new light on her life and work and is essential reading for anyone interested the woman suffrage movement.",

They believe that war in the Middle East is God\u2019s will for the region. In this timely book, Victoria Clark first explores the 400-year history of this powerful political ideology, laying to rest the idea that Christian Zionism is a passing craze or the province of a lunatic fringe. Then Clark surveys the contemporary Christian Zionist scene in Israel and in the United States, where the influence of the religious fundamentalists has never been greater.<\/P><P style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">\u00a0<\/P><P style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">Clark engages with Christian Zionism directly, interviewing leaders, attending events, and traveling with Christian Zionists in the Holy Land. She also investigates the Christian Zionist presence in Israel. She finds that the view through the Christian Zionist lens is dangerously simple: President Bush\u2019s War on Terror is a mythic battle between good and evil, and Syria and Iran represent the powers of darkness. Such views are far from rare\u0097an estimated fifteen to twenty million Americans share them. Almost one in three Americans believes Israel was given to the Jews by God as a prelude to the Battle of Armageddon and Jesus\u2019 Second Coming. Clark concludes with an assessment of Christian Zionists\u2019 impact on American foreign policy in the Middle East and on America\u2019s relationships with European allies since the attacks of 9\/11.<\/P>",

The operation, under the command of Admiral Barbarossa, came in response to a request from Fran\u00e7ois I of France for assistance from Sultan S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent in France's struggle against Charles V, the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. This military alliance between mutual 'infidels', the Christian French King and the Muslim Sultan, aroused intense condemnation on religious grounds from the Habsburgs and their supporters as an aberration from accepted diplomacy. Memories of the Crusades were, after all, still very much alive in Europe and an alliance with 'the Turk' seemed unthinkable to many. Allies with the Infidel places the events of 1543 and the subsequent wintering of the Ottoman fleet in Toulon in the context of the power politics of the sixteenth century. Relying on contemporary Ottoman and French sources, it presents the real politik of diplomacy with 'infidels' in the early modern era. The result is essential reading for students and scholars of European history, Ottoman Studies, and of relations between the Christian and Islamic worlds.<\/p>",

Always a consummate professional, she was also a prominent social reformer whose interest in the environmental causes of disease and in promoting equitable living conditions developed during her years as a resident at Jane Addams' Hull-House. This legendary figure now comes to life in an integrated work of biography and letters that reveals the personal as well as the professional woman. In documenting Hamilton's evolution from a childhood of privilege to a life of social advocacy, the volume opens a window on women reformers and their role in Progressive Era politics and reform. Because Hamilton was a keen observer and vivid writer, her letters - more than 100 are included here - bring an unmatched freshness and immediacy to a range of subjects, such as medical education; personal relationships and daily life at Hull House; the women's peace movement; struggles for the protection of workers' health; academic life at Harvard; politics and civil liberties during the cold war; and, the process of growing old. Her story takes the reader from the Gilded Age to the Vietnam War.",

Now the recent death of the clan's patriarch, a former U.S. senator, has placed his son, Governor Josh Quintrell, squarely in the spotlight as he prepares his run for the highest political office in the land. It is not a good time to be rattling skeletons in the family's closets.<\/p><p>Researching personal histories isn't just Carolina \"Carly\" May's profession, it's her passion. When the governor's eccentric Aunt Winifred invites Carly into the Quintrells' private Taos compound to compile a genealogical record of the illustrious residents, she can hardly believe her good luck. But digging into the past is raising troubling questions about the would-be president's private life, his late father and catatonic mother, and the grisly street crime that left his notorious drug-addicted sister dead. And it soon becomes frighteningly apparent that the motivation of the dotty old woman who hired Carly might be something more akin to revenge -- and that someone is determined to remove the inquisitive genealogist from the picture by any means necessary.<\/p><p>As a dark world of twisted passions and depraved crimes slowly opens up before Carly, she realizes that there is no one whom she dares to trust -- perhaps least of all Dan Duran, a dangerous and haunted mystery man who's somehow tied to the Quintrells' past. But she will need an ally to survive the terrible secrets a father carried to the grave and an even more devastating evil that lurks among the living -- because following the bloodlines of the wealthy and power-hungry can be a bloody business ... and some dead secrets can kill.<\/p>",

But here\u2019s the rub about her job as a baker \u2026 Emma is diabetic. When she tastes her creations, it can only be in the most minute portions. Emma is considered an artisan for the stunning cr\u00e8me brulee wedding cake that won her the Passionate Palette Award last year, but she\u2019s never even had one full slice of it. <br \/> <br \/> When Jackson Drake hears about this local baker who has won a prestigious award for her wedding cake artistry, he tells his assistant to be sure and include her in the pastry tastings scheduled at his new wedding destination hotel the following week. And for Jackson, that particular day has started out badly with two workmen trapped in a broken elevator and a delivery of several dozen 300-thread-count bed linens in the wrong size abandoned in the lobby. But when the arrogant baker he met a week prior in Roswell stumbles into the dining room with a platter of pastries and a bucketful of orders, he knows for certain: It\u2019s going to be a really rotten day.<br \/> <br \/> Can these two ill-suited players master the high-wire act and make a go of their new business venture? Or will they take each other crashing downward, without a net? And will the surprise wedding at The Tanglewood be theirs?",

There's room for one more, always room for one more!\" In this sing-song story, derived from an old Scottish nursery tale, Lachie's boundless magnanimity, while well-received, backfires. The welcoming chap invites all passersby into his home, until the wee house literally explodes with his goodwill. Luckily, the grateful visitors devise a plan to help Lachie and his family (and themselves as well).<p> Sorche Nic Leodhas tells Lachie's story in the lilting, rhyming brogue of a time-worn Scottish folktale. A glossary helps readers through the less intuitive dialect, and Loedhas also provides a musical score so the main chorus of the legend can be sung as originally intended. Nonny Hogrogian's illustrations combine intricately crosshatched line drawings with sponge smudges of moss and berry hues. The effect, impressive enough to earn Hogrogian the Caldecott Medal, is one of a dreamy, watery heath, populated by jovial elfin sprites. The generosity of this tale is addictive, and readers will love being welcomed into Lachie's fold, time and time again. <I>(Picture Book)<\/I>",

The text employs a \"spiral\" pedagogical approach: the first six chapters use Alice's innovative drag-and-drop environment to introduce OO concepts through the medium of computer animation, while the final eight chapters use pure Java to revisit and expand on those same concepts. The text introduces core programming topics--including objects, classes, methods, variables, parameters, control structures, inheritance, and data structures--using the visually stimulating context of 3D animation to ensure that students are both motivated and prepared to continue their studies in Computer Science.",

Amidst all the jewels, and velvet and coronets, and the fine uniforms, she exuded an unworldly simplicity.  Seated with the royal family, she was a part of them, yet somehow distanced from them.  Inasmuch as she is remembered at all today, it is as this shadowy figure in gray nun's clothes...\"<br><br>Princess Alice, mother of Prince Phillip, was something of a mystery figure even within her own family.  She was born deaf, at Windsor Castle, in the presence of her grandmother, Queen Victoria, and brought up in England, Darmstadt, and Malta.<br><br>In 1903 she married Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, and from then on her life was overshadowed by wars, revolutions, and enforced periods of exile.  By the time she was thirty-five, virtually every point of stability was overthrown.  Though the British royal family remained in the ascendant, her German family ceased to be ruling princes, her two aunts who had married Russian royalty had come to savage ends, and soon afterwards Alice's own husband was nearly executed as a political scapegoat.<br><br>The middle years of her life, which should have followed a conventional and fulfilling path, did the opposite.  She suffered from a serious religious crisis and at the age of forty-five was removed from her family and placed in a sanitarium in Switzerland, where she was pronounced a paranoid schizophrenic.  As her stay in the clinic became prolonged, there was a time where it seemed she might never walk free again.  How she achieved her recovery is just one of the remarkable aspects of her story.<br>",

In addition to a fuller presentation and analysis of the original field research, the author has updated the text to incorporate more recent studies and assisted by Kate Bennett, a gerontological psychologist, analyzed new research with a group of women in Leicester, England.

By the time she was thirty-five, virtually every point of stability was overthrown.

She suffered from a serious religious crisis and at the age of forty-five was removed from her family and placed in a sanitarium in Switzerland, where she was pronounced a paranoid schizophrenic.  As her stay in the clinic became prolonged, there was a time where it seemed she might never walk free again.  How she achieved her recovery is just one of the remarkable aspects of her story.<br>",

Baron reveals that online and mobile technologies--including instant messaging, cell phones, multitasking, Facebook, blogs, and wikis--are profoundly influencing how we read and write, speak and listen, but not in the ways we might suppose. Baron draws on a decade of research to provide an eye-opening look at language in an online and mobile world. She reveals for instance that email, IM, and text messaging have had surprisingly little impact on student writing. Electronic media has magnified the laid-back \"whatever\" attitude toward formal writing that young people everywhere have embraced, but it is not a cause of it. A more troubling trend, according to Baron, is the myriad ways in which we block incoming IMs, camouflage ourselves on Facebook, and use ring tones or caller ID to screen incoming calls on our mobile phones. Our ability to decide who to talk to, she argues, is likely to be among the most lasting influences that information technology has upon the ways we communicate with one another. Moreover, as more and more people are \"always on\" one technology or another--whether communicating, working, or just surfing the web or playing games--we have to ask what kind of people we are becoming, as individuals and as family members or friends, if the relationships we form must increasingly compete for our attention with digital media.",

The sensationalistic trial made headlines throughout the  world, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Yet opinion remained fiercely divided about Marks- -was she a spurned woman who had taken out her rage on two innocent victims, or was she an  unwilling victim herself, caught up in a crime she was too young to understand? Such doubts  persuaded the judges to commute her sentence to life imprisonment, and Marks spent the next 30  years in an assortment of jails and asylums, where she was often exhibited as a star attraction. In  <I>Alias Grace<\/I>, Margaret Atwood reconstructs Marks's story in fictional form. Her portraits  of 19th-century prison and asylum life are chilling in their detail. The author also introduces Dr  Simon Jordan, who listens to the prisoner's tale with a mixture of sympathy and disbelief. In his  effort to uncover the truth, Jordan uses the tools of the then rudimentary science of psychology.  But the last word belongs to the book's narrator--Grace herself.",

Levels of organization are examined from the subcellular, cellular, and morphological standpoints, leading to discussions involving physiology, biochemistry, culture methods, and finally, the role of algae in human society. New findings are provided to demonstrate that the world of algae is still ripe with discovery for those students who keep their eyes and their minds active and open. <BR><BR>Algae: Anatomy, Biochemistry, and Biotechnology stands as a hybrid, offering something of a cross between a typical review and a descriptive monograph.

She exhaustively details her fascinating results in <I>The Alex Studies<\/I>.<p>  Pepperberg bought Alex--a parrot of average intelligence and without lofty pedigree or training--from a pet store when he was 1. Since working with Pepperberg, he has developed a 100-word vocabulary and can identify 50 different objects, recognizing quantities up to six, distinguishing seven colors and five shapes, and understanding the difference between big and small, same and different, over and under. He can tell you, for instance, that corn is yellow even if there is no corn in view, as well as correctly select the square object among various shapes and identify it verbally. What this all means, stresses Pepperberg, is that Alex is not merely parroting but actually thinking; he bases answers on reason rather than instinct or mimicry.<p>  Though the anecdotes are rich and Alex makes a lively subject, this is principally a research paper relying on intricate details and a prodigious amount of data (the notes and references alone run to 79 pages)<br><br>. This is not light reading, particularly for the layperson. Still, <I>The Alex Studies<\/I> manages to be more than a valuable contribution to science, for in providing ample evidence of our similarities to other creatures, the book ultimately calls into question the concept of human supremacy over the animal kingdom. Pepperberg's stated goal is \"to provoke awareness in humans that animals have capacities that are far greater than we were once led to expect, and to remind us that all we need to examine these capacities are some enlightened research tools.\" She has provided such tools in this seminal work. <I>--Shawn Carkonen<\/I>",

Who is she, what does she sound like, is she strong or weak? Headstrong or passive? If an   author doesn\u2019t have a clear vision in her head, writing a novel centering around this person is going to be   very, very difficult.<\/p> <p>Fortunately for me, I had a clear vision; so clear I could actually see it and read it myself. I was inspired to write <em>Alice I Have Been<\/em> after unexpectedly viewing a photographic exhibit called   \"Dreaming in Pictures: The Photography of Lewis Carroll.\" Among the many photographs there, all taken by the   man who wrote <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through   the Looking Glass<\/em>, one stood out to me. It was of a young girl clad only in rags, but with an   expression on her face that stopped me in my tracks. She was so adult, so frank, so worldly, as she gazed at   the man behind the camera.<\/p> <p>She was 7-year-old Alice Liddell, the daughter of Dean Henry Liddell of Christ Church, Oxford. It was to   her that Lewis Carroll--or Charles Dodgson, as she knew him--told the story of a little girl who tumbled down   a rabbit hole. She was the one who begged him to write it down.<\/p> <p>I wondered what happened to her after she grew up; I wondered what happened between the two of them to   result in such a startling photograph.<\/p> <p>I wondered so much that I decided to write about it, write her story in her own \"words\"--although of   course, with historical fiction, I got to make those words up. But she was my protagonist, and immediately the   most important factor in writing this novel was known to me. For the girl in the photograph, and the girl in   the classic books, were one and the same; they were my Alice, and I knew her voice, I knew who she was because   of them. The wise yet wary face in the photograph, the unflappable voice of the girl in the books--all I had   to do was capture it on the page.<\/p> <p>My task, then, was to show that voice, that personality, maturing naturally through the years as she   continued to try to leave Wonderland behind. But the difficult work was done for me, I truly believe, all   because of the collaboration between two remarkable people--Alice Liddell and Lewis Carroll. What happened   between the two of them 150 years ago continues to fascinate and inspire. It gave the world Wonderland, after   all--<\/p> And it gave me my heroine. Sometimes all you have to do is open your eyes and look around you for inspiration;   look at a photograph, read a book. I\u2019m so very glad that I did.<em>--Melanie Benjamin<\/em> <p><\/p> <hr size=\"1\" \/> <span class=\"h1\"><strong>Alice Liddell Through the Years<\/strong><\/span> <p><\/p> <p><strong>Click on thumbnails for larger images<\/strong><\/p> <table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" style=\"height: 278px;\" width=\"747\"> <tbody style=\"text-align: left;\"> <tr style=\"text-align: centert;\"> <td style=\"text-align: center;\"><span><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">\"Alice as a Beggar Girl.\"<\/span><\/span><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">\"Alice Liddell, as a Young Woman\"<\/span><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">\"Alice Pleasance Liddell Hargreaves, 1932.\"<\/span><\/td> <\/tr> <tr style=\"text-align: left;\"> <td style=\"text-align: center;\"><center> <img src=\"http:\/\/g-ecx.images-amazon.com\/images\/G\/01\/rando<br><br>EMS\/Alice-photo-1_sm.jpg\" style=\"border:   0;\" \/><\/center><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: left;\"><center>  <img src=\"http:\/\/g-ecx.images-amazon.com\/images\/G\/01\/rando<br><br>EMS\/Alice-photo-2_sm.jpg\" style=\"border:   0;\" \/><\/center><\/td> <td style=\"text-align: left;\"><center>  <img src=\"http:\/\/g-ecx.images-amazon.com\/images\/G\/01\/rando<br><br>EMS\/Alice-photo-3_sm.jpg\" style=\"border: 0pt none;\" \/><\/center><\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody> <\/table> <hr size=\"1\" \/>",

Only eight years after serving out a prison sentence for  murder, Socrates Fortlow lives in a tiny, two-room Watts apartment, where he cooks on a hot plate,  scavenges for bottles, drinks, and wrestles with his demons. Struggling to control a seemingly boundless  rage--as well as the power of his massive \"rock-breaking\" hands--Socrates must find a way to  live an honorable life as a black man on the margins of a white world, a  task which takes every ounce of  self-control he has. <P> Easy Rawlins fans might initially find themselves disappointed by the absence of a mystery to unravel. But  it's a gripping inner drama that unfolds over the pages of these stories, as Socrates comes to grips with the  chaos, poverty, and violence around him. He tries to get and keep a job delivering groceries; takes in a  young street kid named Darryl, who has his own murder to hide; and helps drive out the neighborhood  crack dealer. Throughout, Mosley captures the rhythms of Watts life in prose both musical and hard-edged,  resulting in a haunting look at a life bounded by lust, violence, fear, and a ruthlessly unsentimental moral  vision.",

The book blends a unique combination of research, photography, and the voices of those who have lived and live along the alleys. Beasley has uncovered and analyzed a wealth of new information not only about the back buildings of Galveston but also about their occupants and the complex cultural forces at work in their lives.",

This perennially popular Norton Critical Edition again reprints the 1897 editions of Alice&#x2019;s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass along with the 1876 edition of The Hunting of the Snark. Each text is fully annotated and the original illustrations are included. An unusually rich &#x201C;Backgrounds&#x201D; section is arranged to correspond with three clearly defined periods in Lewis Carroll&#x2019;s life. Letters and diary entries interwoven within each period emphasize the biographical dimension of Carroll&#x2019;s writing. Readers gain an understanding of the author&#x2019;s family and education, the evolution of the Alice books, and Carroll&#x2019;s later years through his own words and through important scholarly work on his faith life and his relationships with women and with Alice Hargreaves and her family. Reflecting the wealth of new scholarship on Alice in Wonderland and Lewis Carroll published since the last edition, Donald Gray has chosen eleven new critical works while retaining five seminal works from the previous edition. Two early pieces&#x2015;an essay by Charles Dickens and poem by Christina Rossetti&#x2015;take a satirical look at children&#x2019;s literature. The nine new recent essays are by James R. Kincaid, Marah Gubar, Robert M. Polemus, Jean-Jacques Lecercle, Gilles Deleuze, Roger Taylor, Carol Mavor, Jean Gatt&#x<br><br>E9;gno, and Helena M. Pycior. The Selected Bibliography has been updated and expanded.",
